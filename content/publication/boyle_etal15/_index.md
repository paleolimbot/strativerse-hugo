  abstract: 'Since the first studies reporting recent stratigraphic changes of metal
    concentration in lake sediments, many hundreds of studies have been published
    in the peer-reviewed literature. It is an impossible task to do justice to all
    of these works here; instead we: (1) examine recent methodological advances and
    place these in the context of the historical development of the discipline; and
    (2) explore the various purposes to which such methods have been applied. Such
    a historical emphasis may appear in conflict with the needs of a review of new
    approaches; however, this is not in fact the case for two main reasons. First,
    most new advances supplement rather than replace traditional methods, such that
    a thorough understanding of the practical and theoretical issues impacting these
    is still essential for reliable interpretation of palaeolimnological data. Second,
    while many of the new methods purport to circumvent problems, they achieve this
    only under favourable conditions, not dissimilar to the conditions that influence
    the earlier methods, so the same lesson must be learned anyway. Consequently,
    we use this historical narrative to address the fundamentals of the discipline.The
    chapter comprises two main parts; methodology and applications. The methodological
    section has three subsections: (1) Introduction to processes controlling natural
    variations in metal fluxes and concentrations in lake sediments; (2) Measurement
    of metal concentrations in sediments; (3) Calculation of enrichment or fluxes
    from sediment metal concentration data.There are four main applications subsections
    focusing on the value of lake sediment records of metals derived from mining or
    industry. They are: (1) Geochronological markers in sediments providing chronology
    for other research goals; (2) Lake sediment heavy metal records to quantify pollution
    loading histories, or to identify pollutant sources; (3) Identifying and quantifying
    pre- and post-mining baseline conditions; (4) Identifying pollutant pathways or
    environmental processes regulating heavy metals.'
