  abstract: Reconstructing the history of metal deposition in Singapore lake sediments
    contributes to understanding the anthropogenic and natural metal deposition in
    the data-sparse Southeast Asia. To this end, we present a sedimentary record of
    Pb, Pb isotopes and eleven other metals (Ag, As, Ba, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Ni, Tl, U
    and Zn) from a well-dated sediment core collected near the depocenter of MacRitchie
    Reservoir in central Singapore. Before the 1900s, the sedimentary Pb concentration
    was less than 2 mg/kg for both soil and sediment, with a corresponding 206Pb/207Pb
    of ∼1.20. The Pb concentration increased to 55 mg/kg in the 1990s, and correspondingly
    the 206Pb/207Pb decreased to less than 1.14. The 206Pb/207Pb in the core top sediment
    is concordant with the 206Pb/207Pb signal of aerosols in Singapore and other Southeast
    Asian cities, suggesting that Pb in the reservoir sediment was mainly from atmospheric
    deposition. Using the Pb concentration in the topmost layer of sediment, the estimated
    atmospheric Pb flux in Singapore today is ∼1.6 × 10−2 g/m2 yr. The concentrations
    of eleven other metals preserved in the sediment were also determined. A principal
    component analysis showed that most of the metals exhibit an increasing trend
    towards 1990s with a local concentration peak in the mid-20th century.
