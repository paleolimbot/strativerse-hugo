  abstract: Recent and historical deposition of mercury (Hg) was examined over a broad
    geographic area from southwestern Northwest Territories to Labrador and from the
    U.S. Northeast to northern Ellesmere Island using dated sediment cores from 50
    lakes (18 in midlatitudes (41−50°N), 14 subarctic (51−64°N) and 18 in the Arctic
    (65−83°N)). Distinct increases of Hg over time were observed in 76% of Arctic,
    86% of subarctic and 100% of midlatitude cores. Subsurface maxima in Hg depositional
    fluxes (μg m−2 y−1) were observed in only 28% of midlatitude lakes and 18% of
    arctic lakes, indicating little recent reduction of inputs. Anthropogenic Hg fluxes
    adjusted for sediment focusing and changes in sedimentation rates (ΔFadj,F) ranged
    from −22.9 to 61 μg m−2 y−1 and were negatively correlated (r = −0.57, P < 0.001)
    with latitude. Hg flux ratios (FRs; post-1990)/pre-1850) ranged from 0.5 to 7.7.
    The latitudinal trend for Hg ΔFadj,F values showed excellent agreement with predictions
    of the global mercury model, GRAHM for the geographic location of each lake (r
    = 0.933, P < 0.001). The results are consistent with a scenario of slow atmospheric
    oxidation of mercury, and slow deposition of reactive mercury emissions, declining
    with increasing latitude away from emission sources in the midlatitudes, and support
    the view that there are significant anthropogenic Hg inputs in the Arctic.
