  abstract: 'This study analyses 1800 years of heavy metal accumulation in a remote
    alpine lake experiencing long-range atmospheric contamination and additional inputs
    of Ag from cloud seeding. In comparison to previous work undertaken on peats,
    lake sediments show limited post-industrial metal enrichment with enrichment factors
    of Ag: 1.3, Pb: 1.3, Zn: 1.1, Cu: 1.2 compared to Ag: 2.2, Pb: 3.3, Zn: 2.1, Cu:
    4.1 for peat. We show this to be the result of substantial fluvial lithogenic
    flux of metals (92–97% of total metal flux) to the lake. Total annual metal flux
    to the lake ranges from: Ag: 4–12 ng/cm2/yr to Zn: 3 383–11 313 ng/cm2/yr. As
    a result, any contribution of cloud seeding to additional enrichment of Ag in
    lake sediments is considered negligible. Results show that metal enrichment is
    not necessarily ubiquitous through a landscape. This has implications for predicting
    the impacts of atmospheric metal pollution to complex environmental systems.'
