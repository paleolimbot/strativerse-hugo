  abstract: Chemical analyses were done on cores of bottom sediment from three locations
    in Lake Livingston, a reservoir on the Trinity River in east Texas to identify
    trends in water quality in the Trinity River using the chemical record preserved
    in bottom sediments trapped by the reservoir. Sediment cores spanned the period
    from 1969, when the reservoir was impounded, to 1992, when the cores were collected.
    Chemical concentrations in reservoir sediment samples were compared to concentrations
    for 14 streambed sediment samples from the Trinity River Basin and to reported
    concentrations for soils in the eastern United States and shale. These comparisons
    indicate that sediments deposited in Lake Livingston are representative of the
    environmental setting of Lake Livingston within the Trinity River Basin. Vertical
    changes in concentrations within sediment cores indicate temporal trends of decreasing
    concentrations of lead, sodium, barium, and total DDT (DDT plus its metabolites
    DDD and DDE) in the Trinity River. Possible increasing temporal trends are indicated
    for chlordane and dieldrin. Each sediment-derived trend is related to trends in
    water quality in the Trinity River or known changes in environmental factors in
    its drainage basin or both.
