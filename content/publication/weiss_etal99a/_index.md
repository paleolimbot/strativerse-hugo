  abstract: Sphagnum mosses received from a herbarium and collected recently from
    a peat bog surface, were used to assess the isotopic character of past and recent
    atmospheric Pb deposition in Switzerland and to constrain possible Pb sources.
    Lead removed from the moss surface was isotopically similar to that measured in
    the corresponding solid plant, suggesting that neither preservative actions for
    the herbarium samples nor dust had affected the isotopic composition of the samples.
    The addition of HCl to aqueous extracts to remove surface particles from the plants
    released more Pb compared to H2O alone. The changes in isotope ratios between
    Sphagnum collected during the past c. 130yr were significantly greater than the
    small fluctuations between and among species collected at any one time. Three
    isotope ratio plots and emission inventories indicated that the most likely source
    of atmospheric Pb was coal-burning at the turn of the century, fly ash from waste
    incineration until approximately 1950, and gasoline combustion after that. The
    pollution record derived from the Sphagnum plants is in good agreement with other
    archives from Switzerland (peat, sediment, ice) and with other herbarium records
    in Europe.
