  abstract: FLUXES of lead to the Great Lakes are dominated by atmospheric depositions
    of industrial lead, which account for ∼ 64% of the lead inputs to Lake Ontario
    and >90% of the inputs to Lake Superior1. It has recently been demonstrated that
    lead aerosols in the Great Lakes region may be identified by the contrasting 206Pb/207Pb
    ratios of industrial leads from the United States (1.221 ±0.009) and Canada (1.151
    ±0.010)2. Here we show that those ratios may also be used to identify and trace
    industrial lead inputs to the Great Lakes. These corroborate spatial gradients
    in lead concentrations in surface waters, which range from 290 pmol kg−1 in Hamilton
    Harbour to <10 pmol kg−1 in the central waters of Lake Ontario. The latter concentrations
    and corresponding residence-time estimates, which are both an order of magnitude
    lower than previously reported, indicate that lead is rapidly scavenged in the
    epilimnion during periods of high primary productivity. We find that industrial
    lead from Canada and the United States are the two principal sources of lead contamination
    in the Great Lakes.
