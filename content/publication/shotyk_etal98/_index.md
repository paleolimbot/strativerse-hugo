  abstract: A continuous record of atmospheric lead since 12,370 carbon-14 years before
    the present (14C yr BP) is preserved in a Swiss peat bog. Enhanced fluxes caused
    by climate changes reached their maxima 10,590 14C yr BP (Younger Dryas) and 823014C
    yr BP. Soil erosion caused by forest clearing and agricultural tillage increased
    lead deposition after 532014C yr BP. Increasing lead/scandium and decreasing lead-206/lead-207
    beginning 3000 14C yr BP indicate the beginning of lead pollution from mining
    and smelting, and anthropogenic sources have dominated lead emissions ever since.
    The greatest lead flux (15.7 milligrams per square meter per year in A.D. 1979)
    was 1570 times the natural, background value (0.01 milligram per square meter
    per year from 8030 to 5320 14C yr BP).
