  abstract: The form of inorganic mercury in a highly contaminated river-lake system
    in northwestern Ontario was investigated using routine X-ray powder diffraction
    analyses and scanning electron microscopy. Evidence for the occurrence of authigenic
    cinnabar in the peak contaminated zone is shown. The presence of a mercuric sulphide
    mineral indicates anoxic conditions with depth, limits methylation of mercury
    in the lake sediment, and accounts for the progressive burial history of contaminated
    sediments.
