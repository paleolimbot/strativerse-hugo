  abstract: Historic increases in atmospheric mercury loadings caused by anthropogenic
    emissions are documented from sediment cores from seven remote headwater lakes
    in Minnesota and northern Wisconsin. Whole-basin changes in Hg accumulation, determined
    from lakewide arrays of 210Pb-dated cores, show that regional atmospheric Hg deposition
    has increased by a factor of 3.7 since preindustrial times. The relative increase
    is consistent among lakes, although preindustrial Hg accumulation rates range
    from 4.5 to 9 µg/m2 per year, and modern rates range from 16 to 32 µg/m2 per year.
    The distribution of these rates is highly correlated with the ratio of catchment
    area to the lake surface area. Modern and preindustrial atmospheric deposition
    rates of 12.5 and 3.7 µg/m2 per year are calculated from this relationship, along
    with the relative contribution of Hg from the terrestrial catchment. Release of
    atmospheric Hg from catchment soils accounts for 20—40% of the Hg loading to the
    lakes, depending on catchment size. This export represents about 25% of the atmospheric
    Hg falling on the catchments under both modern and preindustrial conditions. The
    absence of geographic trends in either Hg deposition rates or their increase implies
    regional if not global sources for the Hg entering these lakes.
