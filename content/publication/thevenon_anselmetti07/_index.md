  abstract: In order to link the charcoal record from sedimentary archives with the
    combustion processes that reflect past anthropogenic activity, a novel method
    based on automated image analysis was developed. It allows a detailed quantification
    and morphological analysis of the combustion-derived products that were emitted
    in the area of Lake Lucerne (Central Europe) throughout the last 7200 years. Charcoal-particle
    distribution reconstructed from the composite sedimentary record shows that the
    charcoal input is primarily linked to redistribution of detrital μm-size charcoal
    degradation products from surface runoff into the large lake basin. However, the
    independent distribution of the coarser charcoal fraction (>38μm) exhibits four
    major periods of large-scale fire activity around 5500, 3300, 2400, and 530cal.BP.
    These events are synchronous with major anthropogenic changes (lake-dwellings,
    land-use changes, technological innovations), although it is possible that these
    major fire episodes could have been indirectly triggered by climatic deterioration
    and unfavorable environmental conditions. During the late-nineteenth-century,
    a great increase in slag particles and magnetic spherules of fly-ash occurred
    due to the steamboat navigation on Lake Lucerne. The successive burning of wood
    (after AD 1838), coal (after AD 1862), and diesel (after AD 1931) by the steamboat
    traffic produced specific particle shapes, providing valuable chronological markers
    for dating the recent sediments and a proxy for fossil fuel combustion.
