  abstract: Lake Pepin is a natural impoundment formed by damming of the Mississippi
    River about 9,180 radiocarbon years ago (19,600 calendar years) by an alluvial
    fan deposited by the Chippewa River, a tributary of the Mississippi in Wisconsin.
    Unique among 26 Mississippi River impoundments, Lake Pepin has stratigraphically
    preserved Holocene materials, including pollutants, that have been transported
    down the Mississippi. This natural Holocene record can then be compared to changes
    that have occurred since European settlement (ca. AD 1830), and since enactment
    of clean air and water legislation. The most immediate response to settlement
    in the sediments of Lake Pepin was an increase in bulk-sediment accumulation rate.
    This was accompanied by gradual increases in concentrations of phosphorus (P),
    and organic carbon (OC), followed by dramatic increases in these elements beginning
    about 1940. The increase in P was far greater than any of the minor fluctuations
    in P that occurred throughout the Holocene, but the increase in OC was comparable
    to an increase in OC that occurred in the mid-Holocene. The concentrations of
    several metals (for example, cadmium [Cd], and lead [Pb]) also are elevated in
    recent sediments. Increased Cd concentrations lasted only about two decades during
    the industrial era between World War II and the enactment of clean water standards
    in the 1970s. Increased Pb emissions, on the other hand, occurred over more than
    100 years, first from burning of coal and smelting of lead ores, and then, beginning
    in the 1930s, burning of leaded gasoline. Concentrations of Pb in the sediments
    of Lake Pepin decreased to about two times preindustrial levels within a decade
    of enactment of unleaded gasoline restrictions.
