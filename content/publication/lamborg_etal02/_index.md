  abstract: 'Using two different natural archiving media from remote locations, we
    have reconstructed the atmospheric deposition of mercury (Hg) over the last 800–1000
    years in both hemispheres. This effort was designed (1) to quantify the historical
    variation and distributional patterns of atmospheric Hg fluxes in the midlatitudes
    of North America at Nova Scotia (N.S.) and at a comparable midlatitude region
    in the Southern Hemisphere at New Zealand (N.S.), (2) to identify and quantify
    the influence of anthropogenic and natural Hg contributions to atmospheric Hg
    fluxes, (3) to further investigate the suitability and comparability of our two
    selected media (lake sediments and ombrotrophic peat) for Hg depositional reconstructions,
    and (4) to assess the relative importance of wet and dry deposition to the study
    areas. Significant findings from the study include the following: (1) The lake
    sediments examined appear to faithfully record the contemporary flux of Hg from
    the atmosphere (e.g., 1997: N.S. Lakes: approximately 8 ± 3 μg m−2 yr−1; N.S.
    Rain: 8 μg m−2 yr−1). The upper 10 cm (approximately 10 yr) of ombrotrophic peat
    cores from Nova Scotia were dated using a biological chronometer (Polytrichum)
    and were also consistent with the flux data provided by current direct sampling
    of precipitation. These observations place limits on the contribution of dry deposition
    (40 ± 50% of wet flux). Unfortunately, the peat samples could not be dated below
    10 cm. This was due to the apparent diagenetic mobility of the geochronological
    tracer (210Pb). (2) There is no evidence of a significant enhancement in the atmospheric
    Hg flux as a result of preindustrial (<1900 c.e. (Common Era)) activities such
    as the extensive Au and Ag mining in the Americas. (3) A factor of 3 and 5x increase
    in the deposition of Hg to the lake sediment archives was observed since the advent
    of the industrial revolution in New Zealand and Nova Scotia respectively, suggesting
    a worldwide increase in the atmospheric deposition of Hg. Furthermore, this increase
    is synchronous with increases in the release of CO2 from combustion of fossil
    fuels on a global scale. The magnitude of increase since industrialization appears
    larger in Nova Scotia than in New Zealand. This may be due to enhanced deposition
    of Hg as a result of either regional emission of Hg or enhanced regional oxidation
    of Hg°.'
