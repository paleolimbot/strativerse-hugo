  abstract: Records of contaminant deposition from ice cores document the impact of
    changing emissions on remote regions. While variations in Greenland ice core Pb
    concentrations before and after 1970 have been attributed primarily to leaded
    gasoline emissions, discontinuous coarse sampling in these studies provided limited
    temporal resolution. Using a continuous, high-resolution record of Pb and other
    trace element concentrations from 1750 to 1998, we show that large, sustained
    increases in Pb deposition in Greenland occurred >50 years before the introduction
    of leaded gasoline and that non-gasoline lead contamination likely accounted for
    >50% of the cumulative increase in lead deposition and crustal enrichment since
    industrialization. After 1970, mandated emission reductions led to a >75% decline
    in annual lead flux, with most of the decline occurring from 1970 to 1985. Additional
    elemental and isotopic tracers will be needed to provide Pb provenance.
