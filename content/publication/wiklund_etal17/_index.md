  abstract: High-resolution records of anthropogenic mercury (Hg) deposition were
    constructed from 9 lakes located 5â€“75km from the Flin Flon, Manitoba smelter (formerly
    one of North America's largest atmospheric Hg point sources) and 5 lakes in Experimental
    Lakes Area (ELA), Ontario; a region remote from major Hg point sources. Anthropogenic
    Hg deposition, as both a flux and inventory, was determined after accounting for
    lake-specific natural Hg background concentrations, changes in sedimentation and
    sediment focusing. Results show that records of anthropogenic flux and inventory
    of Hg were remarkably consistent among the ELA lakes, but varied by 2 orders of
    magnitude among Flin Flon lakes. The relation between Hg inventories (normalized
    for prevailing wind direction) and distance from the smelter was used to estimate
    the total Hg fallout within a 50km radius in 5year time-steps, thus providing
    a quantitative spatial-temporal Hg depositional history for the Flin Flon region.
    The same relation solved for 8 cardinal directions weighted by the inverse of
    the previously applied wind direction normalization generates a map of Hg inventory
    and deposition on the landscape (Supplementary video). This novel application
    of sediment core data constructs a landscape model and allows for a visualization
    of contaminant deposition with respect to a point major source in both space and
    time. The propensity for Hg to undergo long-range, even global transport explains
    why Hg deposition within 50km of Flin Flon was ~11% of estimated releases. That
    is until smelter releases were reduced >10-fold (post-2000), after which observed
    deposition exceeded smelter releases, suggesting landscape re-emission/remobilization
    of legacy Hg is a major ongoing regional source of Hg.
