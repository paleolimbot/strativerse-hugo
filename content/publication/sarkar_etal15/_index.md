  abstract: We report measurements of 30 major and trace elements (TEs) in sediment
    cores from two high-altitude lakes, West Pine Pond (WPP), and Clear Pond (CP),
    in the Adirondack Mountains of New York State using inductively coupled plasma–mass
    spectrometry. The data are used to deduce atmospheric deposition histories of
    TEs over 130 years. The cores were collected using a gravity corer, sliced, freeze
    dried, and ages determined using 210Pb and 137Cs techniques. TE data in WPP were
    supplemented with our earlier elemental carbon (EC) measurements. Lithophilic
    elements showed no systematic temporal pattern or any significant enrichment over
    their crustal abundances. Anthropogenic TEs exhibited distinct increases beginning
    1900, and peaked around 1920–1970, due apparently to energy-related emissions.
    Peak concentrations of most TEs, except Pb and Hg, were observed at 1921 in WPP
    and 1940s in CP. Concentration of Pb peaked in 1973 in both lakes and Hg only
    in CP at 1965. Lead fluxes were reflective of historical smelter production and
    combustion of coal and leaded gasoline. Copper and zinc fluxes mimicked corresponding
    primary production, while EC fluxes followed the long-term trend for fossil and
    biofuel combustion. TE and EC flux trends were closely related to the growth of
    industrialization in the Central and Midwestern U.S. and changing fuel consumption
    patterns. Compared to peak values, the modern TE fluxes decreased by 25–85%, whereas
    EC decreased by 96%. Apparently, the regulations intended to control pollutant
    emissions have succeeded in reducing atmospheric concentrations of the species
    studied and have improved air quality.
