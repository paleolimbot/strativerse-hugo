  abstract: This paper reports the results of a somewhat exploratory investigation
    of the chemical composition of cores taken from the sediments of a number of lakes
    of the English Lake District. All the lakes studied are of glacial, and therefore
    presumably of synchronous, origin. The depth of post-glacial sediment varies from
    lake to lake but is normally between 4 and 6 m. This material, with which the
    paper is mainly concerned, was laid down during the biologically active phase
    following the end of glaciation approximately 10 000 years ago. Below the organic
    muds of the post-glacial period, the sediment consists of glacial clays, usually
    varved, which pass downward into silty clays and sands the total depth of which
    is at present unknown. The variation in composition of the sediments with depth
    and therefore with time presents a pattern of change which is observed to recur
    in most of the lake sediments studied. This pattern of change is most strikingly
    seen in the variation of carbon content with depth, but related sequences of change
    may be observed in the distribution of major inorganic components, for example
    sodium, potassium and magnesium. The observed changes in composition of the sediment
    can most easily be explained if the sediment is regarded as a sequence of soils
    derived from the drainage areas of the lakes. The composition of the residues
    eventually reaching the lake bed can then be accounted for in terms of the rate
    of erosion of the drainage basin rather than in terms of changing rates of organic
    productivity either on the drainage basin or in the lake waters. The composition
    of the sediments does not appear to be greatly influenced by events within the
    lakes themselves except in the case of elements which may migrate more readily
    under the reducing conditions which may arise in soils and in lake muds. Examples
    of these are iron and manganese, and the distribution of these elements in the
    sediment may be used to deduce the redox conditions in the soils of the drainage
    basin in past times, or in the muds and hypolimnetic waters of the lakes themselves.
    Biological activity within the lake waters may also influence significantly the
    distribution in the sediments of distinctly biophile elements, of which phosphorus
    and sulphur are examples. Even in the case of phosphorus, however, it seems likely
    that co-precipitation reactions may have more influence on deposition efficiency
    than does incorporation into biological tissues. The cause of the apparently synchronous
    changes in erosion intensity recorded in the sediments of the various lakes remains
    in doubt. Some evidence derived from the halogen and boron content of the sediments
    is presented which may suggest at least a synchronism between major climatic changes
    and the variations in erosional activity. Since halogens and perhaps boron are
    largely derived from oceanic air-streams, the rate of deposition of these elements
    may be expected to be related to the 'oceanicity' of the climate at the time of
    deposition of the sediment. A direct relationship is observed between the deduced
    intensity of erosional activity and the halogen and boron content of the sediment.
    The meaning of this relationship is rendered somewhat ambiguous however by consideration
    of possible changes in soil ionic balance attributable to progressive loss by
    leaching of soil-derived anions with the passage of time. Although the gross composition
    of the sediment is largely dependent on conditions in the drainage system rather
    than in the lake waters, some deductions may be made which indicate the availability
    of nutrients dissolved in the waters of the lakes in past times. If material is
    rapidly removed from the drainage basin by erosion, nutrient elements are lost
    to the sediment locked in the lattice of unleached mineral particles. If however
    the rate of erosive removal of soil from the land surface is reduced, the mineral
    particles are held in the soil column in a position which allows more efficient
    leaching of soluble components, which then become available to the living populations
    of the lake.
