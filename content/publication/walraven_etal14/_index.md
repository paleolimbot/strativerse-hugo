  abstract: Lake sediments provide a record of atmospheric Pb deposition and changes
    in Pb isotope composition. To our knowledge, such an approach has not previously
    been performed in The Netherlands or linked to national air monitoring data. Results
    are presented for Pb content and isotope composition of 137Cs dated lake sediments
    from 2 Dutch urban lakes. Between 1942 and 2002A.D. anthropogenic atmospheric
    Pb deposition rates in the two lakes varied from 12±2 to 69±16μgcm−2year−1. The
    rise and fall of leaded gasoline is clearly reflected in the reconstructed atmospheric
    Pb deposition rates. After the ban on leaded gasoline, late 1970s/early 1980s,
    atmospheric Pb deposition rates decreased rapidly in the two urban lakes and the
    relative contributions of other anthropogenic Pb sources — incinerator ash (industrial
    Pb) and coal/galena — increased sharply. Atmospheric Pb deposition rates inferred
    from the lake record a clear relationship with nearby measured annual mean air
    Pb concentrations. Based on this relationship it was estimated that air Pb concentrations
    between 1942 and 2002A.D. varied between 5 and 293ng/m3.
