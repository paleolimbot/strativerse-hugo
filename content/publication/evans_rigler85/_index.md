  abstract: Long-term atmospheric deposition of Pb has been measured using lake sediment
    cores. The average ‘whole-lake’ Pb burden was measured for several lakes in each
    of four regions located throughout Ontario and Quebec, Canada. Since the regions
    were remote to any point source of Ph, large scale variation in atmospheric transport
    could be studied. The results indicate that Pb deposition is highest in South-Central
    Ontario, where lake burdens ranged from 312 to 432 mg m−2, and that it decreases
    in an eastward direction into Quebec. Lowest deposition was at the site farthest
    north, Schefferville, Quebec, where fallout was 31 to 42 mg m−2, less than one-tenth
    of that previously observed in South-Central Ontario. Lead-210 dating of sediment
    cores from the northern site showed that input to these remote lakes has occurred
    over the same time period as in the southern sites.
