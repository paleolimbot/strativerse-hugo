  abstract: Using analyses of lead concentrations, lead isotopes (206Pb/207Pb), and
    spheroidal carbonaceous flyash particles (SCP), we studied sediment accumulation
    patterns in the acidified lake Haärsvatten in southwest Sweden. After determining
    the natural background 206Pb/207Pb ratio (1.5) in deeper sediments in long sediment
    cores from three basins in the lake, we applied an isotope mixing model to quantify
    pollution Pb accumulation in 46 gravity cores. The mean pollution Pb inventory
    in the cores was 2.6 g m−2 (range, 0.3–11 g m−2). Although some variation in Pb
    concentrations can be explained by loss on ignition (LOI) and water depth (together,
    R2adj = 0.33), there is no relationship between pollution Pb inventories and these
    variables. Contrary to the traditional model of sediment focusing, where higher
    accumulations of pollutants are expected in deeper waters, the highest inventories
    for pollution Pb and SCP are generally found at shallow sites (<4 m water depth)
    and not in the three deep basins of the lake (10, 12, and 24 m deep). Furthermore,
    the model for sediment focusing, which may be appropriate for describing the physical
    building of sediments in a lake basin, may be inappropriate for describing the
    specific processes controlling the distribution of pollutants in a lake basin
    of this type.
