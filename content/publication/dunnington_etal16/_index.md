  abstract: Small, temperate lakes are important to communities across Canada, but
    commonly lack the long-term water quality records that are required to assess
    the impact of development and environmental change. We measured a combination
    of bulk sediment geochemistry and stable isotopes of carbon and nitrogen in a
    210Pb- and 14C-dated sediment core from Alta Lake, Whistler, British Columbia.
    Channel avulsion at AD 1754 ± 81 on the 21-Mile Creek alluvial fan resulted in
    increased deposition of organic matter with a signal of autochthonous production.
    A decrease in δ13C beginning at AD 1949 ± 17 indicates an increase in pelagic
    productivity relative to benthic productivity and/or sewage input to Alta Lake.
    A corresponding increase in δ15N indicates an increase in sewage-derived nutrients
    during the same time period. These changes were synchronous and coincide with
    the onset of rapid development in the Whistler Valley. Increased metal deposition
    (Cu, As, and Zn) during the same period resulted from watershed disturbance during
    highway construction. Cu, As, and Zn concentrations correlated positively with
    C concentrations and negatively with Ti and K, suggesting removal of metals from
    the water column is closely related to autochthonous organic matter deposition.
    Fe/Mn ratios and Mo concentrations were expected to respond to hypolimnetic oxygen
    availability in response to decreased flushing rate and increased productivity
    following the loss of inflow from 21-Mile Creek, but did not display a clear time-stratigraphic
    signal. Collectively, these data suggest that the combination of bulk geochemistry
    and stable isotopes was an effective suite of variables for inferring environmental
    change and the effects of development on Alta Lake.
