  abstract: Sediment cores collected from several lakes in northern Canada have been
    analyzed for mercury and several other chemical contaminants. Sites ranged from
    the Experimental Lakes Area of northwestern Ontario, north to Cornwallis Island,
    and west to the southern Yukon. Cores were sliced at sites of collection and individual
    slices were freeze dried and analyzed for Pb-210 and Cs-137 to estimate average
    time intervals of deposition. The earliest date estimated by Pb-210 was about
    1850, and mercury concentrations in some lakes were clearly increasing before
    then, assuming no vertical movements of mercury within the sediments. Extrapolation
    of dates downward to deeper slices, assuming a constant sedimentation rate, indicated
    that in some lakes mercury inputs increased slowly even in the 1500's, more rapidly
    after 1750, and more rapidly yet over the current century. These increases are
    interpreted as increased fluxes of mercury to the lakes as a result of long-range
    transport of atmospheric mercury, since there are no local industrial sources
    of mercury. Slices taken near the bottom of a core are taken to estimate the geological
    component while elevations in excess of that in surface slices are taken to represent
    contamination from fallout. This partitioning suggests that sediments in the eastern
    Northwest Territories are dominated by pollution, while those from the western
    Northwest Territories are influenced more by their geological settings. Two cores
    from Hudson Bay suggest that mercury is increasing there too, but has not yet
    exceeded geological sources. Mercury shows little or no tendency to decline in
    the most recent slices; indicating that inputs of mercury remain at or near their
    historical maxima. Given relatively high and continuing inputs of mercury to northern
    lakes it seems likely that some portion of that mercury may find its way into
    the food chain, hence the long-term prospect is for increasing levels of mercury
    in northern fish.
