  abstract: Because of the different geochemical behaviour of rubidium and strontium
    in earth surface processes, variations of the Rb/Sr ratios in lake sediments were
    used as a geochemical proxy of chemical weathering and past climate in a single
    watershed. Low magnetic susceptibility, low CaCO3, low Sr concentration and, hence,
    high Rb/Sr ratio in the lake sediments indicate weak chemical weathering under
    a cold but wet climate during the Little Ice Age (LIA) in the closed Daihai Lake
    watershed. The concordant change in both Sr and CaCO3 concentrations with δ18O
    values in the Dunde ice core suggests that weak chemical weathering during the
    wet LIA was controlled by air temperature. After the LIA, however, precipitation
    played a dominant role in chemical weathering. Copyright © 2001 John Wiley & Sons,
