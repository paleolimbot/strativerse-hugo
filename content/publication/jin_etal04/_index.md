  abstract: Holocene lacustrine sediments from two isolated lakes in north China are
    investigated. Based on palaeoclimatic significance of independent proxies in lake
    sediments, Holocene chemical weathering, and hence climate change, has been reconstructed
    for dated sediment cores from Daihai Lake and Aibi Lake. During early to mid-Holocene,
    higher weathering intensity occurred in the Daihai catchment under warm and humid
    climate conditions, and this reached a maximum at ˜5 kyr BP. However, synchronous
    proxy shifts from the two widely separated, isolated lake sediments indicate that
    there was a cool climate event during the early to mid-Holocene transition. This
    is characterized by reduced weathering in each catchment, low δ13 C and δ18O of
    authigenic carbonate, and by lake level fluctuations. These might correspond to
    a global cooling signal identified in lakes, oceans, mollusc sequences, and polar
    ice cores, typically centred between ˜8.0 and 8.5 kyr BP. Dry conditions were
    experienced in Greenland, the North Atlantic and surrounding regions, and in broad
    monsoonal regions including Daihai at this time. However, recent extensive evidences
    as well as our data from the Aibi Lake sediments show that cool but wet conditions
    occurred in the central Eurasian continent at this time. After ˜2.5 kyr BP, a
    significant shift of independent sediment proxies indicates the beginning of the
    Neoglaciation with a higher frequency of fluctuations, including both the Medieval
    Warm Period (MWP) and the Little Ice Age (LIA). Our continental records provide
    new evidence of the Holocene climate variability with global significance and
    highlight the different spatial nature of the response to oscillations associated
    with different climate patterns.
