  abstract: 'We have applied a single-bog multi-core approach to reconstruct historical
    Pb and Hg accumulation in an ombrotrophic bog from NW Spain, Chao de Lamoso (Xistral
    Mountains). Mercury was determined using a LECO-ALTEC AMA-254 analyzer, Pb with
    an EMMA-XRF analyzer and stable lead isotopes (four cores) by Quadrupole ICP-MS.
    Maximum concentrations were 74–122μgg−1 for Pb and 142–300ngg−1 for Hg. Higher
    variability was found for Hg than for Pb (2–3 times and 1.5 times, respectively).
    The slopes of the relationship between Hg and Pb cumulative inventories also suggested
    differences in relative accumulation of both elements. This substantial spatial
    variability indicates that, compared with Pb, a more extended sampling may be
    needed for an accurate estimation of Hg accumulation in mires. The isotopic records
    showed higher and almost constant 206Pb/207Pb ratios (average 1.174±0.004) in
    the lower sections and a continuous decrease to the surface (minimum 1.141). By
    using the change in the isotopic composition of Pb we estimated a chronology for
    the last ∼200years which enabled and approximation of the temporal trends in metal
    pollution. Based on the average isotopic composition of the studied cores and
    the application of a simple binary mixing model, six periods with increasing proportions
    of pollution Pb were identified: prior to ∼1875 AD, with an average proportion
    lower than 16%; ∼1875–1910 AD, increasing up to 24%; ∼1910–1950 AD, up to 35%;
    ∼1950–1970, up to 54%; ∼1970–1980 AD, up to 74%; and after ∼1980 AD, increasing
    up to 80%. The period with the highest rate of increase in recent (since ∼1900
    AD) pollution Pb (equivalent to 2% year−1) seems to have started at the maximum
    in Pb accumulation around the early 1970s. The Hg records showed a more simple
    evolution with four main phases: prior to ∼1875 AD with enrichments around 1.5-fold
    the background, ∼1875–1955 AD with increasing enrichments; from ∼1955 AD to ∼1980
    AD with maximum values (up to 4.2-fold); and from ∼1980 AD to present, with a
    steady decline to 2.4-fold. For the most recent period (after ∼1980 AD), the combination
    of decreasing Pb and Hg concentrations and accumulation rates/enrichments, and
    low 206Pb/207Pb ratios, may point to a higher relative importance of local sources
    (i.e. coal burning in a nearby power plant) in atmospheric metal pollution in
    the area.'
