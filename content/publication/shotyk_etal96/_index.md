  abstract: A peat core from a Swiss bog reveals significant enrichments of As, Sb
    and Pb extending back to Roman times, indicating that the anthropogenic fluxes
    of these metals have exceeded the natural fluxes for more than 2000 years. The
    isotopic composition of Pb provides no evidence of vertical downward Pb migration,
    suggesting that the bog has faithfully preserved the historical record of atmospheric
    Pb deposition. Age dating using210Pb (verified independently using pollen markers)
    provides the chronology of changing metal concentrations during the past 150 years.
    Present day enrichment factors (relative to the metal/Sc ratios of typical crustal
    rocks) are of the order of 20 times (As), 70 (Sb), and 130 (Pb). Given the potential
    toxicity of As and Sb, these new findings suggest that the environmental significance
    of these, and perhaps other less common trace elements, deserve more attention.
