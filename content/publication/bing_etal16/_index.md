  abstract: Reconstructing trace metal historical trends are essential for better
    understanding anthropogenic impact on remote alpine ecosystems. We present results
    from an alpine lake sediment from the Eastern Tibetan Plateau to decipher the
    accumulation history of cadmium (Cd), lead (Pb) and zinc (Zn) over last century,
    from the preindustrial to the modern period. Cd, Pb and Zn in the sediment of
    Caohaizi Lake clearly suffered from atmospheric deposition, and the mining and
    smelting were regarded as the main anthropogenic sources. Since the mid-1990s,
    over 80% of trace metals were quantified from anthropogenic emissions. The temporal
    trends of anthropogenic metal fluxes showed that the contamination history of
    Pb was earlier than that of Cd and Zn, which was in agreement with the regional
    Pb emission history, but lagged behind the Pb decline in Europe and North America.
    The fluxes of anthropogenic Cd and Zn were relatively constant until the 1980s,
    increased sharply between the 1980s and the mid-1990s, and then kept the high
    values. The anthropogenic fluxes of Pb showed a marked rise around 1950, and increased
    sharply in the 1980s. In the mid-1990s, this flux reached the peak, and then decreased
    gradually. The Pb deposition flux at present in comparison with other lake records
    in the areas of Tibetan Plateau further demonstrated that trace metals in the
    Caohaizi Lake region were probably from Southwest China and South Asia. Economic
    development in these regions still puts pressure on the remote alpine ecosystems,
    and thus the impact of trace metals merits more attention.
