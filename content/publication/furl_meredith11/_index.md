  abstract: Mercury accumulation rates measured in age-dated sediment cores were compared
    at three Washington state lakes. Offutt Lake and Lake St. Clair are located immediately
    downwind (18 and 28 km, respectively) of a coal-fired power plant and Lake Sammamish
    is located outside of the immediate area of the plant (110 km). The sites immediately
    downwind of the power plant were expected to receive increased mercury deposition
    from particulate and reactive mercury not deposited at Lake Sammamish. Mercury
    accumulation in cores was corrected for variable sedimentation, background, and
    sediment focusing to estimate the anthropogenic contribution (HgA,F). Results
    indicated lakes immediately downwind of the power plant contained elevated HgA,F
    levels with respect to the reference lake. Estimated fluxes to Lake Sammamish
    were compared to measured values from a nearby mercury wet deposition collector
    to gauge the efficacy of the core deconstruction techniques. Total deposition
    calculated through the sediment core (20.7 μg/m2/year) fell just outside of the
    upper estimate (18.9 μg/m2/year) of total deposition approximated from the wet
    deposition collector.
