  abstract: 'This review addresses the quantification of anthropogenic pollutants
    in lacustrine sediments by multidisciplinary analyses including: chronostratigraphy
    using radioisotopes (137Cs) and radiocarbon dates (14C), trace metal analysis,
    faecal indicator analysis, as well as antibiotic-resistant genes by molecular
    analysis. Sediment cores from lakes Lucerne and Geneva that are located at a distance
    of 150 km from each other reveal a synchronous increase in anthropogenic trace
    metals (Pb, Cu, Zn, and Mn) following the industrial revolution in Europe about
    1850. In both lakes, the peak of water pollution by toxic metals due to discharge
    of industrial wastewaters was reached in the middle of the twentieth century.
    During the second part of the twentieth century, both sites show a decrease in
    metal pollution following the implementation of wastewater treatment plants. On
    the contrary, the Vidy Bay of Lake Geneva where the treated wastewaters from the
    city of Lausanne are released since 1964 points out a dramatic increase in trace
    metal deposition. Later, a high increase in organic matter deposition, in bacteria
    (Escherichia coli and Enterococcus faecalis) activity as well as antibiotic-resistant
    genes and bacteria occurred into the bay, simultaneously with the eutrophication
    of the large and deep perialpine lakes in the 1970s due to excessive external
    nutrient loading.'
