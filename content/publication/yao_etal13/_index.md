  abstract: In 2009, two short sedimentary cores (DJZ and DQG) were collected from
    the East Taihu Lake at the lower Yangtze River Basin using a gravity corer. Lead
    isotopes and metals including Pb, Al, Fe, and Ti were measured. Radio nuclides
    including 210Pb and 137Cs were also analyzed for dating of the sediments at both
    cores. The averaged sedimentation rate at DQG site was 0.32 cm/a since the early
    1960s, while at DJZ it was at least 1 cm/a. Significant decline of 206Pb/207Pb
    ratios were observed in DQG from the deeper sediments to near-surface sediments,
    indicating increased anthropogenic lead load to the lake sediments due to human
    impact since the 1970s. The uppermost sediments' lead contents were 2.3 times
    of those before the 1950s. Trends of anthropogenic lead in both cores inferred
    from a lead isotope mixing model were found to be similar to those from Al, Fe,
    and Ti normalization methods. Ti was found to be the best passive tracer element,
    highly in accordance with Pb isotope mixing model results. In DQG, anthropogenic
    lead increased sharply since the 1970s and reached a maximum in 2000s (28 mg/kg
    from lead isotope mixing model), while at DJZ the highest value was 20 mg/kg.
    These results revealed significant anthropogenic lead influx into the lake caused
    by human activities, in good agreement with the economic development in the past
    three decades in China.
