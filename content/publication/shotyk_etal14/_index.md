  abstract: 'Sphagnum moss was collected from 21 ombrotrophic (rain-fed) peat bogs
    surrounding open pit mines and upgrading facilities of Athabasca bituminous sands
    in Alberta (AB). In comparison to contemporary Sphagnum moss from four bogs in
    rural locations of southern Germany (DE), the AB mosses yielded lower concentrations
    of Ag, Cd, Ni, Pb, Sb, and Tl, similar concentrations of Mo, but greater concentrations
    of Ba, Th, and V. Except for V, in comparison to the “cleanest”, ancient peat
    samples ever tested from the northern hemisphere (ca. 6000–9000 years old), the
    concentrations of each of these metals in the AB mosses are within a factor of
    3 of “natural, background” values. The concentrations of “heavy metals” in the
    mosses, however, are proportional to the concentration of Th (a conservative,
    lithophile element) and, therefore, contributed to the plants primarily in the
    form of mineral dust particles. Vanadium, the single most abundant trace metal
    in bitumen, is the only anomaly: in the AB mosses, V exceeds that of ancient peat
    by a factor of 6; it is therefore enriched in the mosses, relative to Th, by a
    factor of 2. In comparison to the surface layer of peat cores collected in recent
    years from across Canada, from British Columbia to New Brunswick, the Pb concentrations
    in the mosses from AB are far lower.'
