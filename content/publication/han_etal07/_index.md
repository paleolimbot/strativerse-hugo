  abstract: A complete record derived from the core from the Daihai Lake in a remote
    area provides new insights into the changing atmospheric heavy metal deposition
    associated with historical industrial activities, the Asian monsoon, long-range
    transport, and the chemical composition of matter derived from weathering of catchment.
    The fluctuation of lithogenic element concentration in the lake sediments can
    readily be explained by a particle sorting effect induced by the Asian monsoon.
    The variation of atmospheric deposition of Cu and Pb shows a similar profile in
    the lower part of the core sediments, and coincides with environmental change,
    with high atmospheric deposition coupled with wet, temperate period; while low
    deposition with dry, cold period, indicating a transport variation of heavy metal
    pollutants entrained by the Asian summer monsoon. From the beginning of nineteenth
    century, the atmospheric deposition of Cu and Pb decreased and then slowly increased.
    This may be associated with the destroyed industry induced by long-term wars in
    China and the less heavy metal pollutants relative to the weak Asian summer monsoon
    in this period. Comparison between atmospheric-derived metal and sediment trap
    metal using Ga as the reference element shows that atmospheric Cu and Pb budgets
    do not exceed the fluvially-induced Cu and Pb budgets in the indirectly disturbed
    area. On average, there have been approximately 5.4 mg m−2 yr−1 of Cu and 5.1
    mg m−2 yr−1 of Pb atmospherically deposited in the region.
