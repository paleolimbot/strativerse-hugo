  abstract: A radionuclide-dated (210Pb and 137Cs) sediment core collected from Hampstead
    Pond No. 1, a North London lake, was used to provide novel data on the historical
    accumulation of microplastic waste in the urban environment. Microplastics were
    extracted from sediments by sieving and dense-liquid separation. Fibres of anthropogenic
    origin dominated the assemblage. Microplastics were first identified by microscopy
    before Raman spectroscopy of selected particles was used to determine the composition
    of synthetic polymers and dyes. Polystyrene microplastic particles were identified,
    in addition to synthetic fibres of polyacrylonitrile, polyvinyl chloride and fibres
    containing synthetic dyes. Concentrations of total microplastics in the sediment
    samples ranged from detection level to 539 particles per kilogram of dried sediment.
    Proliferation of microplastics is evident in the core from the late 1950s to the
    present. Relatively low numbers of particles were found in older sediments, comparable
    to laboratory blanks, highlighting the difficulty of extending a plastic chronostratigraphy
    back to the early twentieth century. This study shows that, with optimisation,
    routine extraction of microplastics from radionuclide-dated lake sediments can
    add an important temporal perspective to our understanding of microplastics in
    aquatic systems.
