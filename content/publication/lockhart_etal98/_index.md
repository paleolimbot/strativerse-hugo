  abstract: Sediment cores were collected from lakes in central and northern Canada
    and from Hudson Bay to compare current and historic net depositions of mercury.
    Cores from most locations were enriched in mercury in the upper layers deposited
    recently relative to deeper, historic layers. The lakes with the greatest enrichments
    in mercury were located in central/southern Canada. This enrichment was interpreted
    as being of anthropogenic origin. Mercury inputs at the Experimental Lakes Area
    (ELA) in northwestern Ontario inferred from a core profile agreed well with inputs
    calculated independently from precipitation and runoff data. Anthropogenic inputs
    of mercury to northwestern Ontario were calculated to be about 9 Âµg m-2 y-1. Considering
    all the locations over the geographic range, the core profiles infer that fluxes
    of mercury have increased on average by about 2 fold over the past half century.
    This is consistent with results from other sites in North America and Europe.
