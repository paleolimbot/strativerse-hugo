  abstract: 'This paper reviews the reconstruction of European Atlantic storm events
    with the contribution of a new stormy reconstruction in its central part. Three
    marsh environments on the island of Yeu were chosen to identify disturbing storm
    events from the Mid- to Late Holocene with vibracore sampling, radiocarbon dating
    and sedimentary analysis. Nine probable intervals of high energy deposition in
    these low-transport-activity environments are estimated: 600–500, near 1590, 2100–1950,
    2850–2350, 3500–3270, 5400–5370, 6650–6510, near 7000 and between 7670 and 7470
    calibrated years before present (cal y BP). By comparison with sedimentological
    paleostorm studies, we confirm six European Atlantic storm events estimated at
    near 600–300, 1700–1100, 2900–2500, 3500–3300, 5500–5100 and 7700–7100 cal y BP,
    corresponding to worldwide Holocene cooling climatic periods. A comparison with
    other storminess reviews of worldwide main stormy coasts shows that Holocene storms
    can increase during global cooling periods in the northern hemisphere.'
