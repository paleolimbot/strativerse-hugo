  abstract: In lake sediment investigations of heavy metal pollution history, it has
    become a common approach to calculate enrichment factors (EFs) by normalizing
    elemental distributions to a reference lithogenic element. However, this approach
    requires that the reference element remains stable once it has been deposited
    to the sediment (it is not affected by diagenetic processes). This is rarely studied
    in well-controlled field experiments. Here, we test the commonly used reference
    elements titanium (Ti), zirconium (Zr), aluminum (Al), and rubidium (Rb). We use
    a unique series of freeze cores collected in different years since 1979 in Lake
    Nylandssjön in northern Sweden. This lake has sediment with distinct varves (annually
    laminated deposit). Element concentrations in individual varves were analyzed
    using X-ray fluorescence (XRF) spectroscopy. By tracking the newly formed surface
    varve from different cores across this core series, i.e., following the element
    concentration in a specific varve as it becomes progressively aged, it was possible
    to assess the potential impact of diagenetic processes on geochemical signatures.
    Results confirm the conservative character of the studied elements; there was
    neither an increasing nor a decreasing concentration trend with time during sediment
    ageing for any of these elements. Secondly, we addressed the question ‘which of
    them is the most appropriate for EFs estimates with the aim of distinguishing
    anthropogenic from geogenic inputs, for example in pollution studies’. To assess
    the reliability of the EFs we used lead (Pb) as an example, because anthropogenic
    Pb in the sediment could be independently calculated using stable Pb isotopes.
    When anthropogenic Pb concentrations calculated with Pb-EFs were compared to the
    anthropogenic Pb concentrations derived from stable Pb isotopes, the differences
    found were 20% for Ti, 10% for Zr, 11% for Al, and 27% for Rb when upper continental
    crust concentrations were used for the background ratio. Based on the results
    from Nylandssjön our suggestions are that (1) when using EFs on a single core,
    which is the normal case in paleolimnology, multiple reference elements should
    be used together and (2) the results from those should be critically evaluated.
