  abstract: The recent history of atmospheric As, Cd, Ni, Pb and Zn deposition and
    the stable Pb isotope signatures were reconstructed from short cores collected
    at three peat bogs along the St. Lawrence Valley (SLV). The onset of industrial
    activity was recorded around 1810â€“1850 AD. As, Cd, Pb and, to a certain extent,
    Ni deposition rates reached maxima between 1940 and the early 1970s. Trace metals
    likely originated from coal-burning and ore smelting between 1850 and 1950 AD,
    and were replaced thereafter, at least in the case of Pb, by the combustion of
    leaded gasolines until the mid-1980s. Trace metal contents and accumulation rates
    were greater in the two cores recovered from the southwestern SLV than further
    northeast, as expected from their proximity to urban and industrial centers of
    eastern Canada and the U.S. Mid-West and the direction of the prevalent winds.
    A rapid decrease in metal accumulation rates since the 1970s suggests that mitigation
    policies were effective in reducing atmospheric metal emissions. Nevertheless,
    metal accumulation rates and stable Pb isotope signatures have not yet returned
    to their pre-industrial values.
