  abstract: Lead concentrations decrease 4-fold in going from the surface of sediments
    in a mountain pond to relatively small values in layers 130 yr old. There is a
    corresponding change in the Pb206Pb207 ratio in the sediments from industrial-like
    values of 1.18 near the surface to natural values of 1.24 at depth. Concentrations
    of Ca, Sr, and Ba remain relatively constant with depth. The excess Pb is shown
    to be of eolian anthropogenic origin, through isotopic, chemical, and mass balance
    relationships with metals in aerosols, dry deposition, and precipitation. This
    proves that inputs of contamination Pb were nearly absent centuries ago in a remote
    non-domesticated subalpine canyon, but are present today in that ecosystem in
    amounts more than 20 times the natural inputs and are irrefutably linked with
    industrial sources. As a consequence of these inputs, present Pb concentrations
    have been elevated 5-fold in plants and 50-fold in animals above natural levels.
    These Pb contamination effects are being caused by present-day atmospheric concentrations
    of ~10 ng Pb/m3. The ecosystem studied here characterizes the vast remote non-domesticated
    regions of North America, and these findings indicate that such regions are highly
    polluted by industrial Pb aerosols.
