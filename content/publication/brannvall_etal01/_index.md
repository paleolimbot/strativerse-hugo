  abstract: 'This paper presents a large palaeolimnological study of the pre-industrial
    and industrial history of atmospheric lead pollution deposition in Sweden. Both
    lead concentrations and 206Pb/207Pb ratios have been analysed in 31 lakes covering
    most of Sweden, plus one lake in north-west Russia. Four of the lakes have varved
    (annually-laminated) sediments. Isotope analysis is a sensitive and effective
    method to distinguish pollution lead from natural catchment lead and to detect
    early pollution influence, because the 206Pb/207Pb ratio in unpolluted background
    sediments in Sweden was > 1.3, while that of lead from pollution, derived from
    ores and coal, was < 1.2. The sediments show a consistent picture of past temporal
    changes in atmospheric lead pollution. These changes include: the first traces
    of pollution 3,500-3,000 yrs ago; a pollution peak in Greek-Roman Times (about
    0 AD); lower lead fall-out between 400 and 900 AD; a significant and permanent
    increase in atmospheric lead fall-out from about 1000 AD; an increase with the
    Industrial revolution; a major increase following World War II; the maximum peak
    in the 1970s; and decreasing fall-out over the last decades. The four varved sediments
    provide high-resolution records of atmospheric pollution. They reveal pollution
    peaks about 1200 and 1530 AD which match the history of metal production in Europe.
    According to the varve records the lead pollution level in the late 1990s had
    decreased beneath the level of the 1530s. The pollution level 1200 AD was about
    35% of the 1980s, when lead pollution was still near its all time high. About
    50% of the total accumulated atmospheric lead pollution deposition through time
    was deposited in the pre-industrial period. The sediments also show a consistent
    picture of the geographic distribution of atmospheric lead deposition over time,
    with higher deposition in south Sweden and declining levels to the north, which
    supports the hypothesis that the main sources of pre-industrial atmospheric lead
    pollution in Sweden were cultural areas in mainland Europe and Great Britain.'
