  abstract: "Relationships between organic matter (OM) compounds and methyl mercury
    concentrations ([MeHg]) have been examined in littoral and offshore sediments
    of Lake Lusignan (Québec). The highest [MeHg] were generally found at the sediment\x96water
    interface with exceptionally high concentrations at littoral sites (5.8 ± 1.3
    ng·g dry weight\x961), which were four times more elevated than at offshore sites
    (1.6 ± 0.77 ng·g dry weight\x961). Source-specific fatty acid (FA) biomarkers
    identified that littoral sediments contained more than twice as much terrestrial
    and bacterial OM compounds than offshore sediments, whereas the amount of labile
    algal OM was three times higher at littoral sites. Results indicate that [MeHg]
    were higher in the presence of labile OM substrates, and the amount of terrestrial
    OM compounds could not predict [MeHg]. Correlations between [MeHg] and FA of Desulfovibrio
    desulfuricans (a  sulfate-reducing bacterium producing MeHg) could significantly
    account for 36% of [MeHg] at offshore sites; however, no significant relationships
    were found at littoral sites. This study illustrates that the microbial dynamics
    involved in producing and degrading MeHg in lacustrine sediments are complex and
    cannot be predicted solely by the quantification of FA biomarkers in D. desulfuricans
    or by biomarkers in the OM itself."
