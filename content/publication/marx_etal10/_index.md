  abstract: Two peat bogs from remote alpine sites in Australia were found to contain
    detailed and coherent histories of atmospheric metal pollution for Pb, Zn, Cu,
    Mo, Ag, As, Cd, Sb, Zn, In, Cr, Ni, Tl and V. Dramatic increases in metal deposition
    in the post-1850 AD portion of the cores coincide with the onset of mining in
    Australia. Using both Pb isotopes and metals, pollutants were ascribed to the
    main atmospheric pollution emitting sources in Australia, namely mining and smelting,
    coal combustion and agriculture. Results imply mining and metal production are
    the major source of atmospheric metal pollution, although coal combustion may
    account for up to 30% of metal pollutants. A novel finding of this study is the
    increase in the otherwise near-constant Y/Ho ratio after 1900 AD. We link this
    change to widespread and increased application of marine phosphate fertiliser
    in Australia's main agricultural area (the Murray Darling Basin).
