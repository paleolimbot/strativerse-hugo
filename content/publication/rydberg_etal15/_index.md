  abstract: 'Organic matter (OM) cycling has a large impact on the cycling of mercury
    (Hg) in the environment. Hence, it is important to have a thorough understanding
    on how changes in, e.g., catchment vegetation – through its effect on OM cycling
    – affect the behavior of Hg. To test whether shifts in vegetation had an effect
    on Hg-transport to lakes we investigated a sediment record from Herrenwieser See
    (Southern Germany). This lake has a well-defined Holocene vegetation history:
    at ~8700years BP Corylus avellana (hazel) was replaced by Quercus robur (oak),
    which was replaced by Abies alba (fir) and Fagus sylvatica (beech) ~5700years
    BP). We were particularly interested in testing if coniferous vegetation leads
    to a larger export of Hg to aquatic systems than deciduous vegetation. When hazel
    was replaced by oak, reduced soil erosion and increased transport of DOM-bound
    mercury from the catchment resulted in increases in both Hg-concentrations and
    accumulation rates (61ngg−1 and 5.5ngcm−2yr.−1 to 118ngg−1 and 8.5ngcm−2yr.−1).
    However, even if Hg-concentrations increased also in association with the introduction
    of fir and beech (173ngg−1), as a result of higher Hg:C, there was no increase
    in Hg-accumulation rates (7.6ngcm−2yr.−1), because of a decreased input of OM.
    At around 2500years BP Hg-accumulation rates and Hg-concentration indicated an
    additional input of Hg to the sediment (316ngg−1 and 10.3ngcm−2yr.−1), which might
    be due to increased human activities in the area, e.g., forest burning or mining.
    Our results contrast those of several paired-catchment studies that suggest a
    higher release of Hg from coniferous than deciduous forest, and there is a need
    for studies with a long-term perspective to increase our understanding of the
    effects of slow and gradual processes on mercury cycling.'
