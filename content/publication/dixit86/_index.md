  abstract: Analysis of surface sediment diatoms from 30 study lakes indicates that
    their distribution is closely related to pH. Surface sediment chrysophytes study
    suggests that the distribution of many chrysophyte taxa is closely related with
    lake water pH. Although these algal microfossils can be used as indicators of
    past lake water pH, their low abundance in the surface sediment samples of acidic
    lakes with high concentrations of certain metals indicates that they may be sensitive
    to high metal concentrations. The sensitivity of chrysophytes to metals was further
    examined by a stratigraphic study of chrysophytes in the sediments of Clearwater,
    Lohi, and Hannah lakes. The history of lake acidification in the study area is
    inferred from the stratigraphic analysis of diatoms and chrysophytes. As a result
    of increase in SO/sub 2/ emissions in the Sudbury basin, acidification occurred
    in Hannah and Clearwater lakes after 1880 and 1930 respectively.
