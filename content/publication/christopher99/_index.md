  abstract: Lake sediment cores from St. John's and surrounding areas were used to
    document anthropogenic impacts since European settlement. Environmental indicators
    preserved in the sediment including, geochemical characteristics, pollen, diatoms,
    soot and charcoal were analyzed in a chronological sequence to document the physical,
    chemical and biological impacts over time. -- Two broad-scale eras of direct soil
    disturbance were identified and related to farming and urban growth. During the
    farming era, between 1750 and 1950, the natural vegetation cover was removed and
    lake sedimentation rates increased. The urban era, which began about 1910, resulted
    in rapid soil erosion and high lake sedimentation rates. During the most intense
    period of urban development, the mid-1960s, the dry sediment influx rate was 160
    times pre-European rates. Storm sewers and pavement played an important role in
    the urban environment, providing a direct path to the lakes for pollutants. --
    Superimposed on these disturbances are atmospheric contributions from coal and
    automobile emissions. Coal combustion, which began about 1800 and increased to
    the mid-1950s, emitted soot and toxic metals, as observed in the lake sediment
    records. Automobile pollution, through leaded gasoline combustion, contributed
    significant levels of lead. Lake sediment records show the highest inputs and
    concentrations of lead occurred about 1970. Lead isotopic ratios suggest two or
    three different gasoline types were used in this area. -- The most notable aquatic
    impact is a pH increase through the last few decades. Reconstructing water pH
    in Quidi Vidi Lake from diatom assemblages showed that the earliest farming had
    little influence on the pH, while an increase of about 1.2 units was observed
    to the 1980s. The recent high pH has been attributed to increased buffering capacity,
    believed to be caused by an increase in Mg and Ca contributions from the dissolution
    of concrete in the watershed. -- The long history of coal combustion and leaded
    gasoline combustion has probably left the local soils charged with soot and heavy
    metals. Although the extent of influence is unknown, these soils may be continuous
    suppliers of contaminants for centuries to come. Any attempt to ameliorate the
    urban lakes and their watershed soils should consider all consequences, since
    the lakes appear to be in a 'city-equilibrium'.
