  abstract: <p><strong>Abstract.</strong> High Hg levels in the pristine lacustrine
    ecosystems of the Nahuel Huapi National Park, a protected zone situated in the
    Andes of Northern Patagonia, Argentina, have initiated further investigations
    on Hg cycling and source identification. Here we report Hg records in sedimentary
    sequences to identify atmospheric sources during the past millennium. In addition
    to global transport and deposition, a potential atmospheric Hg source to be considered
    is the local emissions associated with volcanic activity, because the Park is
    situated in the Southern Volcanic Zone. Two sediment cores were extracted from
    Lake Tonček, a small, high-altitude system reflecting mainly direct inputs associated
    with atmospheric contributions, and Lake Moreno Oeste, a much larger and deeper
    lake having an extended watershed covered mostly by native forest. <br><br> The
    sedimentary sequences were dated based on both <sup>210</sup>Pb and <sup>137</sup>Cs
    profiles. In addition, tephra layers were identified and geochemically characterized
    for chronological application and to investigate any association of volcanic eruptions
    with Hg records. Hg concentrations in sediments were measured along with 32 other
    elements, as well as organic matter, subfossil chironomids, and biogenic silica.
    Observed background Hg concentrations, determined from the sequence domains with
    lower values, ranged from 50 to 100 ng g<sup>&minus;1</sup> dry weight (DW), whereas
    the surficial layers reached 200 to 500 ng g<sup>&minus;1</sup> DW. In addition
    to this traditional pattern, however, two deep domains in both sequences showed
    dramatically increased Hg levels reaching 400 to 650 ng g<sup>&minus;1</sup> DW;
    the upper dated to the 18th to 19th centuries, and the lower around the 13th century.
    These concentrations are not only elevated in the present profiles but also many-fold
    above the background values determined in other fresh water sediments, as were
    also the Hg fluxes, reaching 120 to 150 &mu;g m<sup>&minus;2</sup> y<sup>&minus;1</sup>
    in Lake Tonček . No correlation was observed between Hg concentrations and the
    contents of organic matter, subfossil chironomids, biogenic silica, or the other
    elements determined. However, distinctly increased Hg concentrations were observed
    immediately above some tephra layers, suggesting a link to volcanic events. Extended
    fires might be another potential atmospheric source because the earlier Hg peaks
    coincide with reported charcoal peaks, whereas the upper Hg peaks coincide with
    evidences of extended forest fires from tree-ring data and historical records.</p>
