  abstract: Continuous high-resolution sedimentary record of heavy metals (chromium
    (Cr), copper (Cu), lead (Pb), zinc (Zn), manganese (Mn), and mercury (Hg)), from
    lakes Lucerne and Meidsee (Switzerland), provides pollutant deposition history
    from two contrasting Alpine environments over the last millennia. The distribution
    of conservative elements (thorium (Th), scandium (Sc) and titanium (Ti)) shows
    that in absence of human disturbances, the trace element input is primarily controlled
    by weathering processes (i.e., runoff and erosion). Nonetheless, the enrichment
    factor (EF) of Pb and Hg (that are measured by independent methods), and the Pb
    isotopic composition of sediments from the remote lake Meidsee (which are proportionally
    more enriched in anthropogenic heavy metals), likely detect early mining activities
    during the Bronze Age. Meanwhile, the deposition of trace elements remains close
    to the range of natural variations until the strong impact of Roman activities
    on atmospheric metal emissions. Both sites display simultaneous increases in anthropogenic
    trace metal deposition during the Greek and Roman Empires (ca 300 BC to AD 400),
    the Late Middle Ages (ca AD 1400), and the Early Modern Europe (after ca AD 1600).
    However, the greatest increases in anthropogenic metal pollution are evidenced
    after the industrial revolution of ca AD 1850, at low and high altitudes. During
    the twentieth century, industrial releases multiplied by ca 10 times heavy metal
    fluxes to hydrological systems located on both sides of the Alps. During the last
    decades, the recent growing contribution of low radiogenic Pb further highlights
    the contribution of industrial sources with respect to wood and coal burning emissions.
