  abstract: Evidence from this study suggests the existence of a significant modern
    source for atmospheric Hg deposition in the Sierra Nevada, on the continental
    west coast of the United States. Concentrations of both lead (Pb) and mercury
    (Hg) in the sediments of Lake Tahoe deposited prior to 1850 are similar to concentrations
    in the catchment bedrock, but their concentrations in modern sediments have increased
    6-fold for Pb (average 83 ppm) and 5-fold for Hg (average 0.191 ppm). The lake
    occupies a relatively pristine, nonindustrialized subalpine basin, with a watershed
    to lake surface ratio of only 1.6. Excess accumulation of trace metals in these
    sediments should closely reflect direct atmospheric deposition. On average, since
    1980 there have been approximately 17 mg of Pb and 38 μg of Hg deposited annually/m2
    in excess of the baseline flux. While Pb emissions occurred locally in the Tahoe
    Basin, from combustion of leaded gasoline until about 1985, the deposition of
    atmospheric Hg must represent a predominately regional to global source of contamination.
    Ratios of total modern flux to preindustrial flux are 29 for Pb and 24 for Hg.
    The flux ratio for Pb is somewhat higher than reported from the eastern United
    States and Canada but is not atypical. The flux ratio for Hg is much higher than
    that observed in most other natural aquatic systems without point-source contamination.
