  abstract: The history of atmosheric mercury inputs to remote arctic regions can
    be measured in lake sediment cores using lead-210 chronology. In this investigation,
    total mercury deposition is measured in sediments from Imitavik and Annak Lakes
    on the Belcher Islands in southeastern Hudson Bay, an area in the southern Canadian
    Arctic with no history of local industrial or agricultural sources of contamination.
    Both lakes received background and atmospheric inputs of mercury while Annak also
    received mercury from raw domestic sewage from the Hamlet of Sanikiluaq, a growing
    Inuit community of about 550 established in the late 1960's. Results from Imitavik
    show that anthropogenic mercury inputs, apparently transported through the atmosphere,
    began to appear in the mid-eighteenth century, and continued to the 1990's. Annak
    had a similar mercury history until the late 1960's when disposal of domestic
    sewage led to increased sediment and contaminant accumulation. The high input
    of mercury to Annak confirms that Sanikiluaq residents are exposed to mercury
    through native food sources.
