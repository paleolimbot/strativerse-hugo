  abstract: In this study, the temporal evolution of heavy metal contamination in
    the sediments taken from Lake Chenghai, China, in the recent 60 years, has been
    examined using the methods of 137Cs dating, PIRLA procedure, geochemical normalization
    and calculation of enrichment factor. Fe and Al, the primary lithogenic components,
    were used as reference metals as usual. Most of all, natural post-deposition of
    Cr and Ca could mainly reflect the alternation of natural sources. The heavy metal
    concentration profiles suggests that the historical metal deposition in the sediment
    cores reflects the known history of atmospheric deposition of Cr, Ni, and Zn in
    South China, with an onset of increasing anthropogenic metal accumulation of Pb,
    Ni, Cu and Zn from non-point and point pollutions in the late 1970s and early
    1990s. Statistical results by correlation analysis, principal component analysis
    and cluster analysis suggest that the influences of sedimentary organic matters
    on changes in metals concentrations maybe largely controlled by the trophic status
    in the system and that atmospheric deposition from coal and mine industry could
    affect the variation in sedimentary metals concentrations.
