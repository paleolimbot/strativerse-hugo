  abstract: We present unambiguous records of preindustrial atmospheric mercury (Hg)
    pollution, derived from lake-sediment cores collected near Huancavelica, Peru,
    the largest Hg deposit in the New World. Intensive Hg mining first began ca. 1400
    BC, predating the emergence of complex Andean societies, and signifying that the
    region served as a locus for early Hg extraction. The earliest mining targeted
    cinnabar (HgS) for the production of vermillion. Pre-Colonial Hg burdens peak
    ca. 500 BC and ca. 1450 AD, corresponding to the heights of the Chavín and Inca
    states, respectively. During the Inca, Colonial, and industrial intervals, Hg
    pollution became regional, as evidenced by a third lake record ≈225 km distant
    from Huancavelica. Measurements of sediment-Hg speciation reveal that cinnabar
    dust was initially the dominant Hg species deposited, and significant increases
    in deposition were limited to the local environment. After conquest by the Inca
    (ca. 1450 AD), smelting was adopted at the mine and Hg pollution became more widely
    circulated, with the deposition of matrix-bound phases of Hg predominating over
    cinnabar dust. Our results demonstrate the existence of a major Hg mining industry
    at Huancavelica spanning the past 3,500 years, and place recent Hg enrichment
    in the Andes in a broader historical context.
