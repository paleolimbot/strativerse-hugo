  abstract: Sediment cores were taken from the remote Sagamore and Woods Lakes in
    New York State's Adirondack acid lake region and analyzed for 3 to 7 ring polycyclic
    aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and Ag, Al, As, Be, Cd, Cr, Cu, Hg, Ni, Ph, Se, Sn,
    TI, V, and Zn. With the exception of perylene, all of the parental PAHs, e.g.
    those without sidechains, and several of the metals, Pb, As, and Cd, were found
    to be significantly increased in the sediments of both lakes compared to their
    natural integrated deposits (ng cm−2) and their background concentrations (μg
    g−1 or ng g−1 dry wt). Although the concentrations were generally much higher
    in Woods Lake, the total anthropogenic integrated depositions were about the same
    in both lakes for most of the metals and the 3 to 4 ring PAHs. The prime source
    of most of the 3 to 7 ring PAHs and trace elements measured is ascribed to anthropogenic
    combustion. Anthropogenically derived materials decreased in concentration with
    depth to baseline levels in sediment layers estimated by137Cs analyses to be ∼30
    yr old, while biogenic or crustal derived species remained constant or fluctuated
    with core depth.
