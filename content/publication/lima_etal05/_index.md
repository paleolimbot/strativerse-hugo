  abstract: A high-resolution record of Pb deposition in Rhode Island over the past
    250 yr was constructed using a sediment core from the anoxic Pettaquamscutt River
    basin. The sedimentary Pb concentration record shows the well-described maximum
    associated with leaded gasoline usage in the United States. Diminished Pb variability
    during recorded periods of local industrial activity (1735 to 1847) supports the
    greater importance of regional atmospheric lead transport vs. local inputs. The
    Pb isotopic composition at this site shows a clear maximum in anthropogenic 206Pb/207Pb
    in the mid-1800s. Similar peaks have also been observed in sediments from Chesapeake
    Bay and the Great Lakes, suggesting a common source. Possible causes for this
    event include mining and smelting of Pb ores in the Upper Mississippi Valley district,
    which accounted for almost all Pb production in the United States in that period.
    The timing of this event can provide an important stratigraphic marker for sediments
    deposited in the past 200 yr in the Northeastern United States. The downcore profile
    of anthropogenic 206Pb/207Pb provides a classic example of how changes in the
    mixture of ores for production of tetraethyl lead caused a regional-scale shift
    in the sedimentary record, and suggests that coal could have played a secondary
    role in Pb emissions after 1920.
