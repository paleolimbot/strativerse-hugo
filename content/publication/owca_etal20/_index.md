  abstract: Well-designed monitoring approaches are needed to assess effects of industrial
    development on downstream aquatic environments and guide environmental stewardship.
    Here, we develop and apply a monitoring approach to detect potential enrichment
    of metals concentrations in surficial lake sediments of the Peace-Athabasca Delta
    (PAD), northern Alberta, Canada. Since the ecological integrity of the PAD is
    strongly tied to river floodwaters that replenish lakes in the delta, and the
    PAD is located downstream of the Alberta oil sands, concerns have been raised
    over the potential transport of industry-supplied metals to the PAD via the Athabasca
    River. Surface sediment samples were collected in September 2017 from 61 lakes
    across the delta, and again in July 2018 from 20 of the same lakes that had received
    river floodwaters 2 months earlier, to provide snapshots of metals concentrations
    (Be, Cd, Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb, V, and Zn) that have recently accumulated in these lakes.
    To assess for anthropogenic enrichment, surficial sediment metals concentrations
    were normalized to aluminum and compared to pre-industrial baseline (i.e., reference)
    metal-aluminum linear relations for the Athabasca and Peace sectors of the PAD
    developed from pre-1920 measurements in lake sediment cores. Numerical analysis
    demonstrates no marked enrichment of these metals concentrations above pre-1920
    baselines despite strong ability (> 99% power) to detect enrichment of 10%. Measurements
    of river sediment collected by the Regional Aquatics- and Oil Sands-Monitoring
    Programs (RAMP/OSM) also did not exceed pre-1920 concentrations. Thus, results
    presented here show no evidence of substantial oil sands-derived metals enrichment
    of sediment supplied by the Athabasca River to lakes in the PAD and demonstrate
    the usefulness of these methods as a monitoring framework.
