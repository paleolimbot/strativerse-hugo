  abstract: 'A 6.48 m sediment core sequence from Erhai lake, Yunnan Province, provides
    a multi-proxy record of Holocene environmental evolution and human activity in
    southwest China. These sedimentary records provide proxy time series for catchment
    vegetation, flooding, soil erosion, sediment sources and metal workings. They
    are complemented by independent regional climate time-series from speleothems,
    archaeological records of human habitation, and a detailed documented environmental
    history. The article attempts to integrate these data sources to provide a Holocene
    scale record of environmental change and human–environment interactions. These
    interactions are analysed in order to identify the roles of climate and social
    drivers on environmental change, and the lessons that may be learned about the
    future sustainability of the landscape. The main conclusions are: lake sediment
    evidence for human impacts from at least 7,500 cal year BP is supported by a terrestrial
    record of cultural horizons that may extend back to ∼9,000 cal year BP. A major
    shift in the pollen assemblage, defined by detrended correspondence analysis,
    at ∼4,800 cal year BP marks the transition from a ‘nature-dominated’ to a ‘human-dominated’
    landscape. From 4,300 cal year BP, a change in river discharge responses may signal
    the beginning of hydraulic modification through drainage and irrigation. Major
    increases in disturbed land taxa and loss of forest taxa from 2,200 cal year BP
    onward, also associated with the start of significant topsoil erosion, register
    the expansion of agriculture by Han peoples. It is also the start of silver smelting
    linked to trade along the SW Silk Road with Dali becoming a regional centre. Peak
    levels of disturbed land taxa, topsoil and gully erosion are associated with the
    rise and fall of the Nanzhao (CE 738–902) and Dali (CE 937–1253) Kingdoms, and
    the documented environmental crisis that occurred in the late Ming and Qing dynasties
    (CE 1644–1911). The crisis coincides with a stronger summer monsoon, but exploitation
    of marginal agricultural land is the main driver. These historical perspectives
    provide insight into the resilience and sustainability of the modern agricultural
    system. The largest threat comes from high magnitude-low frequency flooding of
    lower dry farmed terraces and irrigated valley plains. A sustainable future depends
    on reducing the use of high altitude and steep slopes for grazing and cultivation,
    maintaining engineered flood defences and terraces, and anticipating the behaviour
    of the summer monsoon.'
