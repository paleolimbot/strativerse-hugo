  abstract: The copperâ€“zinc smelter at Flin Flon, Manitoba, was historically the largest
    single Hg point-source in Canada, as well as a major source of Zn. Although emissions
    were reported by industry to have declined significantly since the late 1980s,
    these reductions have never been independently verified. Here, the histories of
    Hg and Zn deposition over the past century or more were determined at five lake
    sediment and three peat study sites in the surrounding region. At sites spanning
    the range from heavy to minor pollution, lake sediment Hg and Zn concentration
    and flux profiles increased significantly in the early 1930s after the smelter
    opened. Two of the three peat archives were wholly or partially compromised by
    either physical disturbances or biogeochemical transitions which reduced their
    effectiveness as atmospheric metal deposition recorders. But the remaining peat
    records, including a detailed recent 20yr record at a moderately polluted site,
    appeared to show that substantive reductions in metal levels had occurred after
    the late 1980s, coincident with the reported emission reductions. However, the
    lake sediment results, taken at face value, contradicted the peat results in that
    no major declines in metal concentrations or fluxes occurred over recent decades.
    Mercury and Zn fluxes have in fact increased substantially since 1988 in most
    lakes. We suggest that this discrepancy may be explained by catchment soil saturation
    by historically deposited metals which are now mobilizing and leaching into lakes,
    as has been reported from other smelter polluted systems in Canada, whereas the
    upper sections of the peat cores reflected recent declines in atmospheric deposition.
    However, further research including instrumented wet and dry deposition measurements
    and catchment/lake mass balance studies is recommended to test this hypothesis,
    and to provide definitive data on current atmospheric metal deposition rates in
    the area.
