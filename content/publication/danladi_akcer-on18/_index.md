  abstract: Climate variability is a well-known phenomenon and has been frequently,
    though complex, linked to solar forcing on different time scales. The importance
    of solar forcing related climate variability is crucial in our understanding of
    paleoclimate and future climate changes, as well as building climate models. Here
    in, we present the late Holocene (last ca 1400) climate records from Lake Salda
    in SW Anatolia using high-resolution micro X-ray Fluorescence (μ-XRF), magnetic
    susceptibility (MS), stable isotopes (δ13C and δ18O) and TOC-TIC measurements.
    The age model is constructed by using radionuclide (210Pb, 137Cs and 14C) dating
    methods. The lake's high-resolution multiproxy results revealed lake water level
    fluctuations associated with humid and dry spells during the last 1400 years.
    Periods of higher lake levels are consistent with solar maxima in total solar
    irradiance and vice versa. Moreover, the Lake Salda records clearly show dry Dark
    Ages Cold Period (DACP), humid Medieval Climatic Anomaly (MCA), dry Little Ice
    Age (LIA), and humid Modern Warm Period (MoWP). These records suggest that the
    solar forcing, through its influence on the atmospheric circulation, is the main
    mechanism of climate change during the DACP, MCA, LIA and MoWP in this region.
