  abstract: Chemical and palaeoecological analysis of lake and fluvial sediments reveals
    a range of human impact on the sediment chemistry of four reservoirs in the English
    Midlands. Atmospheric pollution is recorded in both inner city and rural sites
    over the last 150 years. Catchment derived heavy metals at one urban site reveals
    high contamination factors for Pb, Cu, Ni, Zn and Cd. From the phosphorus record
    and from reconstructions based on macrofossil remains, eutrophication is recorded
    at all sites. Recent attempts to evaluate rehabilitation programmes for the inner
    city sites have proved problematical owing to two major problems. First, their
    shallow nature results in a high cost of desilting and, secondly, heavy metal
    contamination makes treatment and disposal of the sediment expensive.
