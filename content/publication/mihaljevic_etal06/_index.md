  abstract: The content and the isotopic composition of lead (Pb) were studied in
    a peat deposit on the ridge of the Brdy Hills, in the vicinity of the Příbram
    metallurgical works, in the Czech Republic. Quadrupole ICP MS was employed to
    determine the elemental composition and 206Pb/207Pb and 208Pb/206Pb isotope ratios.
    The individual layers were dated using α spectrometric measurement of the 210Pb
    activity. The historical time period covered by the studied cores reached back
    to the 18th century. The Pb concentration in the studied profiles varied from
    10 to 550 mg kg−1. The 206Pb/207Pb ratio varied in the range from 1.154 to 1.194
    in the individual parts of the profile. The metallurgy of the Pb ores (206Pb/207Pb∼1.16),
    lithogenic Pb (206Pb/207Pb∼1.2), metallurgical processing of automobile batteries
    (206Pb/207Pb∼1.17) and the combustion of coal (206Pb/207Pb∼1.17–1.19) yield isotopic
    signatures that determine the isotope compositions of the individual profiles.
    Deposition rates between 15 mg m−2 year−1 at the beginning of the 19th century
    and 320 mg m−2 year−1 in the 1980s were determined in the dated profiles. The
    increased deposition rates determined on the dated profiles correspond to the
    increasing production of Pb ores in the Příbram mining area at the turn of the
    19th and 20th centuries. The maximum for metallurgical production corresponds
    to the highest deposition rates recorded in 1960s and 1970s. The current deposition
    rate of 5–89 mg m−2 year−1 Pb is related to erosion of contaminated soils and
    waste dumps.
