  abstract: This study examined long-term stability in water quality of Lake Okataina,
    North Island, New Zealand, inferred from sediments deposited from 1836 to 2009,
    during which time there was a pyroclastic volcanic eruption (Tarawera 1886) and
    successive introductions of invasive mammals. Multiple geochemical proxies were
    analysed stratigraphically for organic matter loading, primary productivity, redox
    potential and phosphorus retention capacity. Organic matter loading to the lake
    is mostly authochthonous (algae) although there was increased allochthonous (terrestrial)
    loading immediately after the Tarawera eruption. After 1920, there was a sustained
    increase in inorganic erosion flux. Primary productivity appeared to increase
    considerably about 1960, but has remained relatively unchanged more recently.
    Our results suggest that the lake could recover from the impact of the volcanic
    eruption within a few decades, but the introduction of mammals may affect its
    resilience and lead to more pervasive impacts on the biogeochemistry.
