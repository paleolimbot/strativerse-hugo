  abstract: Data from 104 sediment cores from the Great Lakes and “inland lakes” in
    the region were compiled to assess historical and recent changes in mercury (Hg)
    deposition. The lower Great Lakes showed sharp increases in Hg loading c. 1850–1950
    from point-source water dischargers, with marked decreases during the past half
    century associated with effluent controls and decreases in the industrial use
    of Hg. In contrast, Lake Superior and inland lakes exhibited a pattern of Hg loading
    consistent with an atmospheric source – gradual increases followed by recent (post-1980)
    decreases. Variation in sedimentary Hg flux among inland lakes was primarily attributed
    to the ratio of watershed area:lake area, and secondarily to a lake’s proximity
    to emission sources. A consistent region-wide decrease (∼20%) of sediment-Hg flux
    suggests that controls on local and regional atmospheric Hg emissions have been
    effective in decreasing the supply of Hg to Lake Superior and inland lakes.
