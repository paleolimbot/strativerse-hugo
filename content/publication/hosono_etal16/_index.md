  abstract: Sediment cores from six lakes situated from north to south on the Japanese
    Archipelago were collected during 2009â€“2010 to investigate the hypothesis that
    deposition of lead (Pb) was coming from East Asia (including China, South Korea
    and eastern part of Russia). Accumulation rates and ages of the lake sediment
    were estimated by the 210Pb constant rate of supply model and 137Cs inputs to
    reconstruct the historical trends of Pb accumulation. Cores from four lakes located
    in the north and central Japan, showed clear evidence of Pb pollution with a change
    in the 206Pb/207Pb and 208Pb/207Pb ratios in the recent sediment as compared to
    the deeper sediment. Among the six studied lakes, significant inputs of anthropogenic
    lead emissions were observed at Lake Mikazuki (north Hokkaido in north Japan),
    Lake Chokai (north of Honshu), and Lake Mikuriga (central part of Honshu). Pb
    isotopic comparison of collected core sediment and previously reported data for
    wet precipitation and aerosols from different Asian regions indicate that, before
    1900, Pb accumulated in these three lakes was not affected by trans-boundary sources.
    Lake Mikazuki started to receive Pb emissions from Russia in early 1900s, and
    during the last two decades, this lake has been affected by trans-boundary Pb
    pollution from northern China. Lake Chokai has received Pb pollutant from northern
    China since early 1900s until 2009, whereas for the Lake Mikuriga the major Pb
    contaminant was transported from southern China during the past 100years. The
    results of our study demonstrate that Japan Archipelago has received trans-boundary
    Pb emissions from different parts of East Asian region depending on location,
    and the major source region has changed historically.
