  abstract: The article presents the results of lithological and geochemical investigations
    of recent sediments of Lake Pusty Staw. The analysed sediments document about
    300 years of the history of this lake. Historical materials indicate that significant
    changes in the catchment of the lake took place from the beginning of the 18th
    century (deforestation and afforestation) followed by 19th century tourist development,
    and 20th century industrialisation. The sediments were dated using the 210Pb and
    137Cs method and core lithology. These made it possible to establish a reliable
    chronology to the year 1730. The calculated sedimentation rates ranged between
    0.17 and 0.83 cm year−1. There was a period of intensified erosion caused by land
    clearance between 1734 and 1810, which resulted in an acceleration in sedimentation
    rate (0.36 cm year−1) and a change of lithological type of sediment from detritus
    gyttja to clayey gyttja. On the basis of Cu, Zn, Cd and Pb content in the sediments,
    it was determined that the beginning of pollution of the lake dates back to the
    19th century and was caused probably by the existence of a health resort. A systematic
    increase in pollution occurred in the 20th century as a result of industrial plants.
    Normalised with respect to Al, the content of heavy metals in polluted sediments
    was from several to twenty times higher than in sediments of the preindustrial
    period, and a comparison of historical materials with changes of sediments in
    most cases made it possible to identify the direct causes of the increase in pollution.
