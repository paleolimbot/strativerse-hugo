  abstract: The Great Salt Lake Basins study area of the National Water-Quality Assessment
    (NAWQA) program, which began in 1997, is increasing the scientific understanding
    of factors that affect surface-water quality within the study-area boundaries
    (fig. 1). One way to improve the understanding of these factors is to look at
    historical trends in existing water-quality data. Unfortunately, short record
    lengths, in- consistent analytical methods, numerous measurements at less than
    detection levels, and questionable accuracy limit the usefulness of historical
    monitoring data for most trace inorganic and organic contaminants found in streams,
    rivers, and lakes in the study area.
