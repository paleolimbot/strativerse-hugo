  abstract: Contamination of the environment from atmospheric deposition during the
    twentieth century is pervasive even in areas ostensibly considered pristine or
    remote from point sources. In this study, Pb concentrations in a 210Pb-dated peat
    core collected from the Okefenokee Swamp, GA were used to assess historical contaminant
    input via atmospheric deposition. Lead isotope ratios were determined by dynamic
    reaction cell ICP-MS (DRC-ICP-MS). Increases in Pb concentration occurred in the
    late nineteenth century and a marked rise in Pb concentrations pre-dated the widespread
    use of leaded gasoline within the US. The 206Pb/207Pb ratios of 1.19 during this
    period were consistent with coal combustion emissions. A later increase in Pb
    concentration, concurrent with a trend toward more radiogenic 206Pb/207Pb ratios
    in gasoline is consistent with an increased input of Pb from leaded gasoline emissions.
    However, it appears that coal combustion emissions remain a major source of Pb
    to the Okefenokee.
