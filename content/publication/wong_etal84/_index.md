  abstract: The flux of Pb, Zn, Cu, Ni and Cd into ten remote lakes in the Algonquin
    Provincial Park of Ontario has been determined. Deviation from constant sedimentation
    rates in recent sediments depicted in the 210Pb profiles can be related to human
    activities within the last 100 years. Sedimentation rates in these softwater lakes
    vary from 0.5 mm yr.−1 (62 g m−2 yr.−1) to 2.9 mm yr.−1 (190 g mm−2 yr.−1). The
    corresponding present-day metal flux rates for Ni, Cu, Pb, Zn and Cd are 0.6–8.4,
    0.7–9.4, 3.7–43.5, 5.0–50.3 and 0.07–0.74 mg m−2 yr.−1, respectively. There is
    an overall 2-fold enrichment for Ni, Cu, Zn and Cd in surficial sediments together
    with a 25-fold increase for Pb. The gyttja contain 25–50% organic matter with
    (organic C)/(organic N) ratios which strongly suggest high influx of allochthonous
    plant debris.
