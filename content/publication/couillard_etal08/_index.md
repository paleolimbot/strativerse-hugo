  abstract: Sources and chronologies of metal contamination were studied in sediment
    cores of three lakes of the Rouyn-Noranda mining area (Québec, Canada) affected
    by atmospheric deposition of anthropogenic contaminants. One of the three lakes
    also received acid mine drainage. The sediments were dated using 210Pb and 137Cs
    and analysed for stable Pb isotope ratios and for total concentrations of 15 elements
    (Ag, Al, Au, Ca, Cu, Cd, Fe, Hg, Mn, Ni, P, Pb, S, Ti, Zn). Stable lead isotopic
    signatures helped to determine the quantitative contributions of different industrial
    Pb sources to our sampling sites. This source apportionment showed the dominant
    influence of the Rouyn-Noranda copper smelter in airborne Pb emissions for the
    decades following 1926, when industrialization began in the region. The smelter
    source had a low ratio of 206Pb/207Pb ranging between 0.90 and 1.05, as typical
    of the Abitibi Archean sulphides. The relationships between element (metal) sedimentary
    fluxes and anthropogenic Pb fluxes allowed us to infer the origin of the anthropogenic
    source. These relationships strongly suggest that the copper smelter was (and
    may still be) an atmospheric source of Cd, Cu, Pb, Zn, Ag and Hg to the surrounding
    lakes. Our study indicates that the efforts made by the Rouyn-Noranda copper smelter
    to reduce airborne emissions of metals have been translated in reduced atmospheric
    metal loadings to the surrounding lakes.
