  abstract: Sediment quality monitoring is commonly used to assess for river pollution
    by industrial activities, but requires knowledge of pre-disturbance conditions.
    This has long been a critical knowledge gap for assessing pollution of the Lower
    Athabasca River within the Athabasca Oil Sands Region (AOSR) because sediment
    quality monitoring started 30 years after mining operations began in 1967. Here,
    we analyze oil-sands pollution indicator metals vanadium (V) and nickel (Ni) in
    sediment cores from five Athabasca River floodplain lakes spanning from 17 km
    upstream to 58 km downstream of central oil sands operations. These data are used
    to define pre-development baseline (i.e., reference) concentrations and assess
    for enrichment in sediment deposited after 1967. Measurements of organic and inorganic
    matter content were used to differentiate periods of strong and weaker Athabasca
    River influence in the sediment records, as needed to discern pathways of metal
    deposition. Numerical analyses reveal that post-1967 V and Ni enrichment factors
    have remained below the 1.5 threshold for ‘minimal enrichment’ (sensu Birch, 2017)
    in stratigraphic intervals of strong river influence in the floodplain lakes.
    Thus, concentrations of V and Ni carried by Athabasca River sediment have not
    become measurably enriched since onset of oil sands development, as demonstrated
    by our before-after study design with >99.99% power to detect a 10% increase above
    pre-development baselines. At the closest lake (<1 km) to oil sands operations,
    however, enrichment factors for V and Ni increased to 2.1 and 1.5, respectively,
    in the mid-1980s and have remained at this level when river influence was weaker,
    indicating contamination via atmospheric transport. Localized enrichment within
    the oil sands region via atmospheric pathways is a greater concern for ecosystems
    and society than local and far-field transport by fluvial pathways.
