  abstract: Sediment sequences spanning the last 800 years from two small lakes in
    the south Swedish uplands were explored for assessment of effects of changing
    human population, local land-use practices and airborne pollution on lake-ecosystem
    functioning and resilience. Variations in nutrient cycling and deposition of lithogenic
    elements were studied, using a multi-proxy stratigraphic approach. Carbon and
    nitrogen elemental and isotopic analyses were applied in combination with records
    of hydrocarbons (n-alkanes) to investigate the sources and depositional conditions
    of sediment organic matter. Changes in fluvial and airborne delivery of inorganic
    matter were based on X-ray fluorescence measurements. The results reveal that
    population growth and related increases in land-use pressure had a major impact
    on catchment erosion and input of terrestrial organic matter to the lakes from
    the 1500s to the end of the 1800s. Evidence also exists of a brief period of catchment
    disturbance at ca. 1200–1300, followed by recovery, likely connected to the Black
    Death pandemic. At ca. 1900 synchronous shifts in most of the proxy records suggest
    a marked change in external forcing common to the two lakes related to a major
    decrease in population density and the introduction of modern forestry following
    the industrial revolution. Interestingly, the two sediment records exhibit generally
    coherent trends in C/N ratio, organic C content and δ13C, both before and after
    1900, indicating broadly similar sensitivities of the lake ecosystems to human
    impact. In contrast, deviating trends in total N content, δ15N and lithogenic
    element concentrations (K, Ti, Rb and Zr) reflect site-specific responses to local
    disturbances during the last century due to different nutrient conditions and
    catchment properties. Our companion sediment records highlight the importance
    of understanding long-term human impact on watersheds and demonstrate how regional
    versus local forcing of lake ecosystems, as well as site-specific responses related
    to catchment characteristics can be reconstructed.
