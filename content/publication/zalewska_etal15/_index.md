    Summary
    The article presents data on heavy metal – Hg, Pb, Cd and Zn – distribution in the layers of marine sediments from the off-shore areas of the southern Baltic Sea: Gdańsk Deep, SE Gotland Basin and Bornholm Deep. Depth profiles of metal concentrations were converted to time-based profiles using the 210Pb dating method and verified by 137Cs distribution in the vertical profile. The linear sedimentation rates in the Gdańsk Deep and SE Gotland Basin are similar, 0.18cmyr−1 and 0.14cmyr−1, respectively, while the region of the Bornholm Deep is characterized by a greater sedimentation rate: 0.31cmyr−1. Regarding anthropogenic pressure, Gdańsk Deep receives the largest share among the analyzed regions. The maximal metal concentrations detected in this area were Zn – 230mgkg−1, Pb – 77mgkg−1, Cd – 2.04mgkg−1 and Hg – 0.27mgkg−1. The least impact of anthropogenic pressure was noticeable in SE Gotland Basin. The combination of sediment dating with the analysis of vertical distribution of heavy metals in sediments benefited in the determination of target metal concentrations used in environmental status assessments. Reference values of heavy metal concentrations in marine sediments were determined as: Zn – 110mgkg−1, Pb – 30mgkg−1, Cd – 0.3mgkg−1 and Hg – 0.05mgkg−1 from the period of minor anthropogenic pressure. Basing on the determined indices: enrichment factor (EF), geoaccumulation indicator (Igeo) and contamination factor (CF) the status of marine environment was assessed regarding the pollution with heavy metals.
