  abstract: Atmospheric mercury fluxes to terrestrial and aquatic surfaces in the
    Northern Hemisphere have increased since the Industrial Revolution. However fluxes
    are not well characterized for the Southern Hemisphere, since environmental archives
    are comparatively scarce. Mercury records from 210Pb-dated sediment cores of three
    South Patagonian lakes were investigated in order to reveal the influence of anthropogenic
    activities on atmospheric mercury deposition in remote lakes of the Southern Hemisphere.
    Comparison with indicators of organic matter sources (carbon and nitrogen/carbon
    ratios) and a conservative mineral soil element (zirconium) in the sediments revealed
    that soil erosion is an important process contributing mercury to these lakes
    and influenced variation in concentrations through time. However, at ~1900AD mercury
    accumulation increased independent from soil erosion and peaked from 1980 to 2000AD.
    We attribute this to an increase in atmospheric mercury deposition in this remote
    region of the Southern Hemisphere. Mean flux ratios, which reflect the increase
    in modern mercury accumulation compared to pre-1850AD, lie within a range of 1.4
    to 2.4. These values indicate an increase in atmospheric mercury deposition slightly
    lower than predictions derived from global mercury models that suggest an increase
    in Hg deposition by a factor of 2 to 3.
