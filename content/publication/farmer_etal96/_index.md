  abstract: Stable lead isotope data can yield information on the geochemical origins
    of lead and on its relative contributions from sources such as coal burning, mining,
    smelting, and car-exhaust emissions. This extremely detailed 206Pb/207Pb profile
    for dated bottom sediments in Loch Lomond, Scotland, shows the trends clearly
    related to the varying nature and extent of anthropogenic lead inputs after 1630.
    In particular, a significant decline in the 206Pb/207Pb ratio of excess lead during
    1929−1991 is attributable to the introduction and use of (206Pb-depleted) leaded
    petrol since the 1920s. This accounts, however, for just 24−53% of the excess
    lead deposited since 1929 and ≤19% of the total excess lead inventory. Deposition
    of lead from industrial (and domestic) activities has predominated overall and,
    on an annual basis, until at least the mid-1950s.
