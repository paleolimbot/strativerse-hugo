  abstract: There has been recent controversy over the discrimination between natural
    and anthropogenic loadings of mercury to lakes. Sediment core profiles have been
    interpreted as evidence that inputs to lakes have increased. Some investigators
    have argued, however, that mercury may be sufficiently mobile in sediments to
    generate profiles that are misinterpreted as historical records. This argument
    can be tested where the histories of inputs of mercury are known independently
    from other kinds of information. We have such cases in Canadian lakes and we have
    been able to assemble sediment core records for comparison with known source histories.
    Three cases are represented by Clay Lake in Ontario where the source was a chlor-alkali
    plant with a known history of mercury discharges, Giauque Lake in the Northwest
    Territories where mercury was used at a gold mine to extract gold from ore, and
    Stuart Lake in British Columbia where a mercury mine operated for a known period
    at Pinchi Lake, the lake immediately upstream from Stuart Lake. In these cases
    lake sediment cores were dated using lead-210 and cesium-137 and then slices were
    analysed for mercury. The histories of mercury deposition derived from the cores
    agreed well with the known histories of inputs.
