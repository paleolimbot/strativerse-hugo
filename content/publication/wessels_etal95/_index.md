  abstract: Sediments in Lake Constance have been dated by radiometric methods and
    lamination counting. Investigations into the concentrations of lead and zinc in
    the sediments were carried out to get detailed information about environmental
    history. Maximum concentrations were found at the beginning of the 1960's. The
    lead maximum contamination occurred 3 years before the zinc maximum and has an
    unidentified source. The use of coal, leaded gasoline or the remobilization within
    the sediment could be excluded to result in the lead maximum. The fluctuations
    in zinc contamination could be explained with increasing and decreasing pollution
    (industry, coal burning, building of sewage plants). The greatest fluctuations
    of both metals occur during periods of great change in the economic history of
    Germany.
