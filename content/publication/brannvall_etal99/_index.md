  abstract: There is great concern for contamination of sensitive ecosystems in high
    latitudes by long-range transport of heavy metals and other pollutants derived
    from industrial areas in lower latitudes. Atmospheric pollution of heavy metals
    has a very long history, and since metals accumulate in the environment, understanding
    of present-day pollution conditions requires knowledge of past atmospheric deposition.
    We use analyses of lead concentrations and stable lead isotopes (206Pb/207Pb ratios)
    of annually laminated sediments from four lakes in northern Sweden (∼65° N) to
    provide a decadal record of atmospheric lead pollution for the last 3000 years.
    There is a clear signal in the sediments of airborne pollution from Greek and
    Roman cultures 2000 years ago, followed by a period of “clean” conditions 400−900
    A.D. From 900 A.D. there was a conspicuous, permanent increase in atmospheric
    lead pollution fallout. The sediments reveal peaks in atmospheric lead pollution
    at 1200 and 1530 A.D. comparable to present-day levels. These peaks match the
    history of metal production in Europe. This study indicates that the contemporary
    atmospheric pollution climate in northern Europe was established in Medieval time,
    rather than in the Industrial period. Atmospheric lead pollution deposition did
    not, when seen in a historical perspective, increase as much as usually assumed
    with the Industrial Revolution (1800 A.D.).
