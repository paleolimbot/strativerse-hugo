  abstract: We measured the vertical distributions of Mo, Fe, Mn, sulfide, sulfate,
    organic carbon, major ions, and pH in sediment porewater from one perennially
    oxic and three seasonally anoxic lacustrine basins in Eastern Canada, as well
    as those of Mo, acid volatile sulfide, Fe, Mn, Al, organic C, 210Pb and 137Cs
    in sediment cores from the same sites. The only input of anthropogenic Mo to these
    lakes comes from atmospheric deposition. The relatively monotonous distribution
    of Mo in the porewater of three seasonally anoxic basins suggests that Mo is not
    redistributed in the sedimentary column during periods of anoxia. In contrast,
    porewater Mo profiles obtained at three sampling dates in a perennially oxic basin
    display sharp Mo peaks below the sediment–water interface, indicating redistribution
    subsequent to deposition. Modeling of these latter porewater Mo profiles with
    a diagenetic reaction-transport equation coupled to comparisons among the various
    porewater and solid phase profiles reveal that Mo is released at 1–2cm depth as
    a consequence of the reductive dissolution of Fe oxyhydroxides and scavenged both
    at the vicinity of the sediment–water interface, by re-adsorption onto authigenic
    Fe oxyhydroxides, and deeper in the sediments where dissolved sulfide concentrations
    are higher. The estimated rate constant for the adsorption of Mo onto Fe oxyhydroxides
    is 36±45cm3mol−1s−1. Diagenetic modeling indicates that authigenic Mo in sediments
    of the perennially oxic basin represents about one-third of the total solid phase
    Mo in the first cm below the sediment–water interface and only one tenth below
    this horizon. If we assume that no authigenic Mo is accumulated in the seasonally
    anoxic lake sediments we conclude that the sediment Mo concentrations, which are
    up to 3–16 times higher than the average lithogenic composition, depending on
    the lake, are mainly due to atmospheric deposition of anthropogenic Mo and not
    to the formation of authigenic Mo phases. Reconstructed historical records of
    the atmospheric Mo deposition indicate maximum values in the 1970s and 1980s and
    significant decreases since then. Emissions to the atmosphere associated with
    the smelting of non-ferrous ores and coal combustion appear to be the most important
    sources of anthropogenic Mo.
