  abstract: Baihua Lake, a man-made reservoir, is one of the five drinking water sources
    for Guiyang City in China's southwestern province of Guizhou. In the present research,
    the distribution and accumulation characteristics of heavy metals (Pb, Cd, As,
    Cu and Zn) for the sediment of this lake were analyzed by examination of 10 recently
    collected samples. A method based on toxic-response factor was applied to assess
    the potential ecological risk of these heavy metals to the water body. For comparison,
    the two sets of reference data representing the pre-industrial and the local baseline
    pollution levels were employed to derive the accumulating coefficients for the
    heavy metals under study. The calculated potential ecological risk indices show
    that the lake was polluted by heavy metals and both cadmium and arsenic loadings
    were critical factors responsible for the ecological hazards posed to Baihua Lake
    by the five elements.
