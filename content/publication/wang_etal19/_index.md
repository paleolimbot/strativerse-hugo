  abstract: Sediment records are widely used to infer impact of atmospheric metal
    deposition in alpine lakes, however, the legacy effect and catchment erosion of
    historical pollutants could potentially affect metal influx into lakes. Here,
    we collect data (including six trace metals and three lithogenic elements) from
    well-dated sediment cores of seven alpine lakes in southeast Tibet, which is adjacent
    to southwest China. This area has a documented history of preindustrial pollution.
    Metals such as cadmium (Cd), zinc (Zn) and arsenic (As) are found at relatively
    low concentrations until a clear increase is observed after 1950s across lakes.
    This result is consistent with accelerating atmospheric metal deposition due to
    socio-economic development in the region. We observe no synchronous trend across
    lakes in the changes of lead (Pb), copper (Cu) and silver (Ag), which show no
    significant increase after âˆ¼1950 over the last two centuries in most of the study
    lakes. The historical trends of 206Pb/207Pb ratio reflect an important source
    of anthropogenic Pb associated with preindustrial mining and smelting in this
    study region, suggesting a substantial impact of legacy contamination from ancient
    mines. Furthermore, the temporal variations in these six anthropogenic metals
    are largely accounted for by terrigenous elements (e.g. aluminum (Al) and titanium
    (Ti)) in most of the study lakes, and to a lesser degree by sediment grain sizes
    and organic matter content, suggesting a significant role of catchment erosion
    in modulating sediment metal signals. In all, this study highlights the legacy
    effect of historical pollutants may have enhanced the forcing of catchment erosion
    in modulating the sediment signals of anthropogenic deposition in southeast Tibet.
