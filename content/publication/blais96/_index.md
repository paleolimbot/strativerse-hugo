  abstract: The isotopic composition of lead pollution in the environment provides
    information as to the source of emission. The 206Pb/207Pb ratio for Canadian industrial
    emissions (1.153±0.005) is significantly less than U.S. industrial emissions (1.213±0.008)
    making it possible to determine the relative contributions of emissions from both
    countries within Eastern North America by means of a simple isotopic mixing model.
    Profundal sediments in lakes chronicle contaminant inputs and are therefore useful
    monitors of environmental pollution. Surface sediment from 32 sediment cores across
    Quebec and Ontario, Canada were analyzed for 206Pb/207Pb to ascertain the relative
    proportions of Pb emission from Canada and the U.S.A. Data show that U.S. contributions
    to the total lead burden in surficial sediments across much of southern Quebec
    and Ontario are often in excess of 50%. Local sources were particularly important
    in the Eastern Township region of Quebec which lies 200 km south east of the city
    of Montreal. The results are discussed in relation to the major sources of industrial
    lead emissions in North America.
