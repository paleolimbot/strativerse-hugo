  abstract: Atmospheric phenomena have a large influence on the flux of mercury (Hg)
    and lead (Pb) to terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. Some direct phenomena involve
    high-frequency variations in air movement; other indirect processes involve longer-term
    changes in climate and associated vegetation and hydrology. Here, we use evidence
    from sediment cores to explore how these atmospheric and landscape processes produced
    large natural variations in Hg and Pb deposition over thousands of years before
    industrial pollution. Cores from Sargent Mountain Pond, coastal Maine, USA (16
    600 years), Plesne Lake, south-western Czech Republic (15 000 years), Lake Tulane,
    central Florida, USA (45 000 years), and Caribou Bog, Orono, Maine, USA (10 000
    years) each illustrate how long-term local environmental changes influence the
    deposition and net retention of Hg and Pb. Important natural factors that emerge
    from comparisons among these four sites include forestation, changing groundwater
    hydrology, evolution of the watershed and lake system and (watershed area)/(lake
    area) ratio, all overlain by late-Holocene anthropogenic atmospheric pollution.
