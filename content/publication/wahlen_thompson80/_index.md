  abstract: 'Sediment core segments from Sylvan Lake, Lake Champlain and Lake Canadarago
    were dated radiometrically with 210Pb and 137Cs. Their respective sedimentation
    rates were determined to be 0.11, 0.14 and 0.52 g cm−2 yr−1. For the two lakes
    of lower sedimentation the variations of selected elemental abundances as function
    of depth were analyzed. Two groupings were found: Al, K, Ti, Rb and Zr were correlated
    among themselves but reflected different variations in the input of terrigenous
    erosion material to the lakes. The Cu, Zn and Pb correlated among themselves showed
    similar depth dependence with increasing concentrations toward the top which can
    be attributed to cultural pollution. Recent ‘excess’ fluxes to the sediments above
    the natural contribution by clastic material were derived for the location of
    the cores, which for Cu, Zn and Pb amounted to 3.8, 24 and 16 μg cm−2 yr−1 respectively
    for Sylvan Lake and 4.9, 20 and 16 μg cm−2 yr−1 for Lake Champlain. The corresponding
    210Pb flux was 3.3 and 2.3 dpm cm−2 yr−1, respectively for the two lakes. Approximate
    residence times in the water column were obtained for trace metals at the Lake
    Champlain location. Short residence times estimated for Pb (< 0.15 yr) and Cu
    (< 0.4 yr) indicate fast removal, whereas those for Zn (1.0 ± 0.3 yr) and Cr (2.0
    ± 0.5 yr) appeared to be dominated by the water residence time.'
