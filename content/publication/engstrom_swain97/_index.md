  abstract: Historic increases in atmospheric mercury deposition caused by anthropogenic
    emissions have been well documented from sediment cores from lakes and peatlands
    in North America and Europe. Few previous studies have addressed the question
    of whether mercury deposition has increased continuously to the present or whether
    it has declined in recent decades. We present stratigraphic data from a suite
    of Minnesota lakes that indicate mercury deposition peaked in the 1960s and 1970s,
    at least for the upper Midwest. Recent declines, which appear in both rural and
    urban lakes, are not evident in sediment cores from remote coastal lakes in southeastern
    Alaska. Because the Alaskan sites provide an integrated sample of mercury pollution
    in the Northern Hemisphere, these results imply that global mercury emissions
    have not abated and that decreased inputs to Midwestern lakes are caused by reduced
    emissions from regional sources. U.S. inventory data suggest that decreased emissions
    likely resulted from reduced industrial use of mercury, use of pollution-control
    technologies that incidentally capture mercury, a shift from coal to natural gas
    for commercial and residential heating, and a decrease in uncontrolled waste incineration.
    Increased stack height and other factors that favor long-distance transport could
    be partially responsible for the trend.
