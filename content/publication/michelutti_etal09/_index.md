  abstract: Concentrations and stable isotope ratios of lead (Pb) from lake sediments
    were used to quantify temporal patterns of anthropogenic Pb pollution in the Clyde
    River region of Baffin Island, Arctic Canada. Surface sediments from eight lakes
    on eastern Baffin Island and one from northern-most Greenland, spanning a gradient
    of 20° latitude, showed great variability with respect to Pb concentration and
    stable isotopic Pb ratios, with little apparent latitudinal trend. To constrain
    the temporal evolution of regional Pb pollution, a well-dated core from one of
    the sites, Lake CF8 on east-central Baffin Island, was analyzed geochemically
    at high stratigraphic resolution. A pronounced decrease in the 206Pb/207Pb ratio
    occurs in sediments deposited between 1923 and the mid-1970s, likely reflecting
    alkyl-Pb additives derived from the combustion of fossil fuels at a global scale.
    A two-component mixing model indicates that 17–26% of the Pb in the labile fraction
    of sediments deposited in Lake CF8 between 2001 and 2005 is from anthropogenic
    input. A Pb–Pb co-isotopic plot (206Pb/207Pb vs.208Pb/206Pb ratios) of the Lake
    CF8 time series data indicates multiple possible sources of industrial Pb pollution.
    Despite widespread reductions in industrial Pb emissions since the 1970s, there
    is no evidence for attendant reductions of pollution Pb at Lake CF8. Enhanced
    scavenging from increased primary production as well as changing precipitation
    rates as climate warms may represent important factors that modulate Pb deposition
    to Lake CF8, and Arctic lakes elsewhere.
