title: McCloud Lake
feature_type: water_body
description: Near Putnam County, Florida. A bit unclear where this lake is...conflicting
  information from lat/lon in appendix of @sweets_etal90 and map in @sweets_etal90.
  There is a bathymetric map available (for a McCloud lake in putnam county), but
  lists a lat/lon that does not contain a lake. Plus, the location map seems to indicate
  that McCloud lake is in marion county...
