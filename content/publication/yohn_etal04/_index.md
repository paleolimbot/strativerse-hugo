  abstract: Environmental legislation has reduced the anthropogenic loadings of Pb
    and Cd to the Great Lakes region over the past 3 decades. However, the accumulation
    rates of these metals still remain above background values. Because environmental
    legislation was targeted at major sources (e.g., Pb in gasoline) whose influence
    on the environment was on a regional scale, local sources (e.g., watershed scale)
    for the metals may now play a more significant role. The relative importance of
    regional versus local scale influences on metal inputs to the environment is poorly
    understood. In this study, sediment chronologies of Pb and Cd were examined from
    12 inland lakes that cover the broad geographic area of the State of Michigan.
    These chronologies were compared temporally and spatially and to watershed population
    densities and metal production records to gain an understanding of local and regional
    influences on metal inputs to the Great Lakes region. Results show that anthropogenic
    Pb loading during the 1930s and 1970s was dominated by regional sources, such
    as coal burning and use of leaded gasoline. Current loadings are now more related
    to local influences such as watershed population densities, rather than atmospheric
    deposition. Anthropogenic Cd loadings to the Great Lakes region have been dominated
    by both regional and local sources over time. Lead may also have shown the influence
    of local sources over time, if the influence of emissions from gasoline had not
    been present. This work shows that Pb and Cd loadings in the Great Lakes region
    are strongly related to watershed population densities, however, the specific
    sources and pathways for the metal cycling are unclear.
