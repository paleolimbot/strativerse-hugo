  abstract: Historical changes of anthropogenic Pb pollution were reconstructed based
    on Pb concentrations and isotope ratios in lake and peat sediment profiles from
    Ny-Ålesund of Arctic. The calculated excess Pb isotope ratios showed that Pb pollution
    largely came from west Europe and Russia. The peat profile clearly reflected the
    historical changes of atmospheric deposition of anthropogenic Pb into Ny-Ålesund,
    and the result showed that anthropogenic Pb peaked at 1960s–1970s, and thereafter
    a significant recovery was observed by a rapid increase of 206Pb/207Pb ratios
    and a remarkable decrease in anthropogenic Pb contents. In contrast to the peat
    record, the longer lake record showed relatively high anthropogenic Pb contents
    and a persistent decrease of 206Pb/207Pb ratios within the uppermost samples,
    suggesting that climate-sensitive processes such as catchment erosion and meltwater
    runoff might have influenced the recent change of Pb pollution record in the High
    Arctic lake sediments.
