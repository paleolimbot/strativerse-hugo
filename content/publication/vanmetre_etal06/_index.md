  abstract: This report presents data on major and trace element concentrations in
    sediment cores collected from 35 lakes and reservoirs during 1994-2001. The lakes
    and reservoirs are located in or near 18 major urban areas across the United States
    and provide a geographically diverse coverage of urban land use for the country
    as well as some reference settings. Vertical intervals of the cores were analyzed
    for eight major elements and eight trace elements.
