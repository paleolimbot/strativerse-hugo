  abstract: In this study we report analyses of lead in annual ice layers from the
    interior of northern Greenland and in annual layers of ice from the interior of
    the Antarctic continent. We show that lead concentrations increase from <0.001γPb/kg
    ice at 800 BC to >0.200 γPb/kg ice today in north pole ice sheets, the sharpest
    rise occurring after 1940, and that the levels of lead in south polar ice sheets
    are generally below our detection limits before 1940 and rise only to about 0.020
    γPb/kg ice after 1940 (in this paper the symbol gamma, γ, means microgram, 10−6
    g). The increase of lead with time in north polar snows is ascribed mainly to
    lead smelteries before 1940 and to burned lead alkyls after 1940. The difference
    between the concentrations of lead in northern and southern polar snows is ascribed
    to barriers to north-south tropospheric mixing which originate from meridional
    circulating cells and which hinder the migration of aerosol pollutants from the
    northern hemisphere to the Antarctic. Our observations of the chemical concentrations
    of the common elements in ice from the interior of Greenland and Antarctica can
    be explained in terms of simple relations among sea salts and terrestrial dusts.
    We found about ten times more dust in Greenland interior ice (35 γ/kg) than in
    Antarctic interior ice (~2 γ/kg), but found twice as much sea salt in Antarctic
    interior ice (110 γ/kg) than in Greenland interior ice (67 γ/kg). We found that
    the proportions of sodium, chlorine, magnesium, calcium, and potassium adhered
    closely to sea salt ratios in ices that were relatively free of silicate dusts,
    even when the concentrations of sea salts decreased from 1100 γ/kg in NW coastal
    Greenland ice to 110 γ/kg in Rockefeller Plateau ice in the Antarctic interior.
    We also found that the amounts and chemical composition of silicate dusts in Greenland
    were no different in coastal and interior ices, averaging 3 γ Mg, 5.6 γCa, 2.0
    γK, 0.1 γTi and 6.8 γSi per kg ice respectively in the interior. We found that
    there are seasonal variations in the amounts of pollutant lead, sea salts and
    silicate dusts in the snows, pollutant lead and sea salts being two or three times
    more concentrated in winter than in summer snows, while silicate dusts were three
    times more concentrated in spring than in winter snows. The above interpretation,
    which unifies all the data, is consistent with most related chemical and meteorological
    observations at temperate latitudes.
