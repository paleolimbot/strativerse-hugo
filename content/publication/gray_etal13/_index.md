  abstract: Concentrations and isotopic compositions of Hg and Pb were measured in
    a sediment core collected from Lake Ballinger, near Seattle, Washington, USA.
    Lake Ballinger has been affected by input of metal contaminants emitted from the
    Tacoma smelter, which operated from 1887 to 1986 and was located about 53km south
    of the lake. Concentrations and loadings of Hg and Pb in Lake Ballinger increased
    by as much as three orders of magnitude during the period of smelting as compared
    to the pre-smelting period. Concentrations and loadings of Hg and Pb then decreased
    by about 55% and 75%, respectively, after smelting ended. Isotopic compositions
    of Hg changed considerably during the period of smelting (δ202Hg=−2.29‰ to −0.38‰,
    mean −1.23‰, n=9) compared to the pre-smelting period (δ202Hg=−2.91‰ to −2.50‰,
    mean −2.75‰, n=4). Variations were also observed in 206Pb/207Pb and 208Pb/207Pb
    isotopic compositions during these periods. Data for Δ199Hg and Δ201Hg indicate
    mass independent fractionation (MIF) of Hg isotopes in Lake Ballinger sediment
    during the smelting and post-smelting period and suggest MIF in the ore smelted,
    during the smelting process, or chemical modification at some point in the past.
    Negative values for Δ199Hg and Δ201Hg for the pre-smelting period are similar
    to those previously reported for soil, peat, and lichen, likely suggesting some
    component of atmospheric Hg. Variations in the concentrations and isotopic compositions
    of Hg and Pb were useful in tracing contaminant sources and the understanding
    of the depositional history of sedimentation in Lake Ballinger.
