  abstract: Depth profiles of mercury, lead and its stable isotopes, and polycyclic
    aromatic hydrocarbons were determined in a dated sediment core from the Levantine
    basin. Sedimentary records show that preindustrial fluxes and levels of Hg, Pb,
    and PAHs remained generally constant in the region before 1850. An almost concurrent
    uniform increase of both metals and PAHs deposition occurring at the beginning
    of the Industrial Revolution suggests coal combustion as a main source of these
    contaminants in the Levantine basin after the 1850s. However, none of the contaminant
    profiles indicates a decline after 1950–60, the characteristic period of coal
    use reduction. The modern fluxes of Hg and Pb reveal a 3- to 5-fold increase over
    preindustrial loads, while the contemporaneous flux of PAHs rises by 4–7 times.
    On the whole, records in the Eastern Mediterranean suggest atmospheric inputs
    from relatively distant sources, likely from Central and Eastern Europe.
