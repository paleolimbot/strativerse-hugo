  abstract: The history of the atmospheric deposition of major and trace elements
    over southwestern Quebec, Canada, was reconstructed using multielemental analysis
    of lacustrine sediments sampled in a small and undisturbed lake located on top
    of a mountain in the heart of the industrialized St. Lawrence Valley. Acid leachable
    and residual elements were extracted from a 37-cm long core (1-cm resolution)
    using clean techniques and analyzed by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry.
    Organic matter and sulfur concentrations were high and played a major role in
    the low postdepositional diagenetic remobilization of many trace elements. Sulfur,
    manganese, iron, arsenic, molybdenum and barium displayed a high mobility making
    it exceedingly difficult to infer unambiguously time-dependent changes in atmospheric
    deposition for these elements. Atmospheric deposition rates for the less mobile
    elements (e.g., potassium, vanadium, chromium, cobalt, nickel, copper, zinc, rubidium,
    cadmium, tin, antimony, mercury, thallium, lead, and bismuth) increased regularly
    between 1942 and 1960–1975 in the Lake Hertel area and then stabilized for most
    of these elements, with the exception of nickel, copper, zinc and tin. Lead deposition
    rate was reduced by about 25% between 1982 and 1995, and a slight decreasing trend
    was also found for cobalt, mercury, and thallium during the same period. Present-day
    atmospheric deposition of metals directly on the lake surface represents a small
    percentage of the sedimentary deposition rates at this location. Deposition followed
    by surface runoff and outwash of terrestrial organic and inorganic matter most
    likely is the driving mechanism leading to the non-diagenetic enrichment of metals
    in Lake Hertel sediments.
