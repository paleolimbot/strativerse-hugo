  abstract: In this paper we report analyses of four peat cores taken from a mountain
    valley in the French Pyrenees where ancient metallurgical and agro-pastoral activities
    have occurred. By combining a range of geochemical and chronological proxies we
    investigated (1) the importance of PHTE (Potentially Harmful Trace Element) accumulation
    during pre-industrial times compared to recent accumulation, and (2) the intimate
    relationship between landscape use and terrestrial PHTE transfers. We show how
    long human-environment interaction in mountain environments and pre-industrial
    anthropogenic activities led to PHTE accumulation equal to or even exceeding that
    of modern times. Atmospheric contamination by PHTE occurred throughout 500 BC
    − AD 500 for lead (Pb) and antimony (Sb), AD 1200–1600 for only Pb, and the last
    150 years for Pb, Sb and copper (Cu) combined. Lead isotopes allowed determination
    of the impact of Pb contamination from significant local mining and metallurgical
    activities during the Middle Ages. An estimation of PHTE inventories derived from
    atmospheric deposition suggests that 85% of Pb accumulation occurred before AD
    1800, thus highlighting the influence of past local activities to the accumulation
    of atmospheric contaminants compared to that of more recent periods. Enhanced
    erosion input to one of the mires is evident from AD 1600 to 1950, and intensive
    grazing coupled with forest clearings are the likely cause of these rapid transfers
    of natural PHTE and previously stored Pb to downstream mires. Remobilized Pb in
    the impacted peatland represent at least one third of the total Pb-inventory,
    suggesting that terrestrial transfers were important and acting as hotspot sources
    of PHTE accumulation.
