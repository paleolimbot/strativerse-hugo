  abstract: Ages of small aragonite samples retrieved from sediments from the Daihai
    Lake are determined by using the Thermal Ionization Mass Spectrometry (TIMS) technique.
    The ages of the samples range from (8740±601) to (10446 ±489) a, with a precision
    of 2%–3% for non-corrected dating ages and 4.7%-9.8% for corrected ages respectively,
    and are consistent within the deviation range. At about 10.5 ka BP, the grain-size
    of the sediments coarsens sharply, the frequency curves of grain-size distribution
    show coarse grain dominated single-double kurtosis, indicating cooling, decreased
    hydrodynamic conditions and increased wind influence procedure. This is in good
    agreement with previous results obtained from the Daihai Lake, which suggests
    that the climate was cold and the lake surface was shrinking. The TIMS ages of
    the sediments are therefore believed to be credible.
