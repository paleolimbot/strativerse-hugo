  abstract: Lakes situated in urban environments are commonly subjected to a variety
    of anthropogenically induced pressures. Since 1920, First Lake in Lower Sackville
    has been the focus of watershed development and lake water quality degradation
    is an ongoing concern. A paleolimnological approach was undertaken to provide
    insight into the relationship between watershed development and water quality.
    A year-long study of limnological conditions in the lake and a historical survey
    of existing data were conducted to characterize seasonal physical and chemical
    lake conditions. First Lake stratifies strongly during the summer and algal blooms
    and hypolimnic anoxia commonly occur. Survey results indicate that shallow Secchi
    disk depths (< 2 m), strong stratification (~6 m), neutral pH values, and oxygen-deprived
    bottom waters (<5%) commonly develop as the summer progresses. A 33 cm long sediment
    core from the lake basin captured approximately 600 years of sediment accumulation.
    Atmospheric Pb concentrations were used to approximate sedimentation rates. Pre-development
    (pre-1920) data indicate a productive, likely mesotrophic lake. Higher Î´ 15N values
    and lower C/N ratios near the top of the core indicate increased primary productivity
    within the lake as a result of increased nutrient input from early agricultural
    development after 1920. Changes in concentrations of Ti, Cu, K, loss-on-ignition
    and magnetic susceptibility values indicate landscape instability, and an increase
    in sediment and toxin transfer into the lake associated with urbanization in 1960.
    These data indicate that changes in water quality in First Lake are strongly linked
    to specific anthropogenic activities in the watershed, an understanding of which
    is a fundamental factor in developing effective lake management strategies.
