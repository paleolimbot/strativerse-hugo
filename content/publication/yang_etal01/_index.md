  abstract: The aim of the project is to provide additional contemporary metals (especially
    mercury) data to that currently available and to place them in a temporal context
    on both a short time scale (annual variability in depositional values) and, using
    lake sediments, decadal scales within London and still longer scales (centuries)
    at selected sites across the UK. The report includes a summary of work in progress
    (January - March 2000) and the data available at the end of March 2000. It also
    includes retrospective mercury data for deposition in London for the period January
    - December 1999. 4 refs., 4 figs.
