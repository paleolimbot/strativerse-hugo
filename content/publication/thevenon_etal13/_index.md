  abstract: The 137Cs and 210Pb dating of a 61-cm long sediment core retrieved from
    a drinking water reservoir (Lake Brêt) located in Switzerland revealed a linear
    and relatively high sedimentation rate (∼1cmyear−1) over the last decades. The
    continuous centimeter scale measurement of physical (porewater and granulometry),
    organic (Corg, P, N, HI and OI indexes) and mineral (Cmin and lithogenic trace
    elements) parameters therefore enables reconstructing the environmental history
    of the lake and anthropogenic pollutant input (trace metals, DDT and PCBs) at
    high resolution. A major change in the physical properties of the lowermost sediments
    occurred following the artificial rise of the dam in 1922. After ca. 1940, there
    was a long-term up-core increase in organic matter deposition attributed to enhance
    primary production and anoxic bottom water conditions due to excessive nutrient
    input from a watershed predominantly used for agriculture that also received domestic
    effluents of two wastewater-treatment plants. This pattern contrasts with the
    terrigenous element input (Eu, Sc, Mg, Ti, Al, and Fe) which doubled after the
    rising of the dam but continuously decreased during the last 60years. By comparison,
    the trace metals (Cu, Pb and Hg) presented a slight enrichment factor (EF) only
    during the second part of the 20th century. Although maximum EF Pb (>2) occurred
    synchronously with the use of leaded gasoline in Switzerland (between ca. 1947
    and 1985) the Hg and Cu profiles exhibited a relatively similar trend than Pb
    during the 20th century, therefore excluding the alkyl-lead added to petrol as
    the dominant (atmospheric) source of lead input to Lake Brêt. Conversely, the
    Cu profile that did not follow the decrease registered in Pb and Hg during the
    last 10years, suggests an additional source of Cu probably linked to the impact
    of agricultural activities in the area. In absence of heavy industries in the
    catchment, the atmospheric deposition of DDT and PCBs via surface runoff followed
    the historical emissions of POPs in Switzerland. Such result highlights the regional
    contamination of freshwater resources by the large-scale emission of toxic industrial
    chemicals in the 1960s and 1970s as well as the efficiency of the regulatory measures
    subsequently taken.
