  abstract: 'Peat cores were collected from three minerogenic peatlands in Switzerland:
    La Tourbière des Genevez (TGE), in Canton Jura; Gola di Lago (GDL), in Canton
    Ticino; and Mauntschas (MAU), in Canton Grisons. Chemical analyses of the pore
    waters and the peats document the increasingly minerogenic character with depth.
    In particular, the Sr concentration profile in the peats reflects the growing
    importance of mineral sediment dissolution with increasing distance below the
    peat surface. Despite this circumstance, Pb concentrations are greatest in the
    surface layers, and decrease with depth. Thus, dissolution of the basal sediments
    at these sites appears to be an unimportant source of Pb, compared with atmospheric
    deposition. Twenty-one new radiocarbon age dates for the three cores provide a
    chronology of Pb enrichment, and these are consistent with the record of atmospheric
    Pb deposition recorded by the ombrotrophic peat bog ‘Etang de la Gruère’ (EGR).
    Sediment samples from TGE and EGR were reacted at pH 5 with ammonium acetate to
    dissolve the carbonate fraction, filtered, and the residues analyzed using XRF.
    These analyses show that much of the Ca, Mg, Sr and Mn is lost when the carbonate
    fraction is dissolved, but this process does not measurably affect Pb. This finding
    suggests that carbonate dissolution dominates the weathering of the sediments
    underlying these peat deposits, but this fraction does not contain significant
    concentrations of Pb. Minerogenic peat deposits such as those described here,
    therefore, can serve as reliable archives of atmospheric Pb deposition, provided
    that mineral dissolution in the underlying sediments does not contribute measurably
    to the Pb inventory of the peat profile.'
