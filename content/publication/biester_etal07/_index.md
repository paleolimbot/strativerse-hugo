  abstract: Historical records of mercury (Hg) accumulation in lake sediments and
    peat bogs are often used to estimate human impacts on the biogeochemical cycling
    of mercury. On the basis of studies of lake sediments, modern atmospheric mercury
    deposition rates are estimated to have increased by a factor of 3−5 compared to
    background values:  i.e., from about 3−3.5 μg Hg m-2 yr-1 to 10−20 μg Hg m-2 yr-1.
    However, recent studies of the historical mercury record in peat bogs suggest
    significantly higher increases (9−400 fold, median 40×), i.e., from about 0.6−1.7
    μg Hg m-2 yr -1 to 8−184 μg Hg m-2 yr -1. We compared published data of background
    and modern mercury accumulation rates derived from globally distributed lake sediments
    and peat bogs and discuss reasons for the differences observed in absolute values
    and in the relative increase in the industrial age. Direct measurements of modern
    wet mercury deposition rates in remote areas are presently about 1−4 μg m-2 yr
    -1, but were possibly as high as 20 μg Hg m-2 yr -1 during the 1980s. These values
    are closer to the estimates of past deposition determined from lake sediments,
    which suggests that modern mercury accumulation rates derived from peat bogs tend
    to over-estimate deposition. We suggest that smearing of 210Pb in the uppermost
    peat sections contributes to an underestimation of peat ages, which is the most
    important reason for the overestimation of mercury accumulation rates in many
    bogs. The lower background mercury accumulation rates in peat as compared to lake
    sediments we believe is the result of nonquantitative retention and loss of mercury
    during peat diagenesis. As many processes controlling time-resolved mercury accumulation
    in mires are still poorly understood, lake sediments appear to be the more reliable
    archive for estimating historical mercury accumulation rates.
