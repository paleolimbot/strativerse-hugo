  abstract: DESPITE evidence from Greenland ice cores for pre-industrial atmospheric
    trace-metal contamination1,2 it is commonly assumed that air pollution in remote
    areas is a recent problem caused by industrial activities, fossil-fuel burning
    and emissions from motor vehicles. Here we report analyses of lake sediments from
    Sweden showing that atmospheric lead deposition increased above back-ground levels
    more than 2,600 years ago. There was a small, but marked lead deposition peak
    about 2,000 years ago, and a more significant increase that began 1,000 years
    ago and accelerated during the nineteenth and particularly the twentieth centuries,
    with a deposition maximum at about ad 1970. Before the nineteenth century industrialization,
    lead concentrations in lake sediments from southern Sweden had already reached
    10â€“30 times previous background levels as a result of atmospheric deposition.
    We suggest that this pre-industrial airborne pollution was derived from extensive
    production and use of lead in Europe, starting with the Greek and Roman cultures3,4.
    The cumulative deposition from anthropogenic sources in pre-industrial times (~600
    bc to ad 1800) was at least as large as the cumulative deposition during the industrial
    period (ad 1800 to the present).
