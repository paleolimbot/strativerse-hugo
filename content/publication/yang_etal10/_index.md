  abstract: We analyzed sediment cores collected from three equatorial zone lakes
    in the Rwenzori Mountains of Uganda for Hg and dated them using 210Pb. The results
    show that the lakes have been contaminated by anthropogenic Hg from atmospheric
    deposition and that the onset of Hg pollution in the region began at least by
    the late 19th century. Mercury accumulation in all sediment cores increased by
    about 3-fold since the mid-19th century, a similar increase to that shown in other
    remote regions worldwide. These results from tropical high-elevation sites are
    the first for this region and contribute to our understanding of global Hg pollution
    trends. The atmospheric boundary layer is at a higher altitude in equatorial areas
    than at midlatitudes, and therefore, Hg deposition in these regions may not be
    enhanced by diurnal penetration of tropospheric air and associated reactive gaseous
    mercury as has been reported for mountain lakes at higher latitudes. Furthermore,
    the relatively low abundance of atmospheric oxidants may limit the amount of gaseous
    elemental mercury oxidized to the reactive gaseous form in equatorial Africa.
    These Rwenzori Hg records therefore have important implications for the understanding
    of Hg dynamics at high elevations in equatorial regions.
