  abstract: Sedimentary records of inorganic elements and pigments over the last 12,000â€¯years
    are used to assess major changes in limnological conditions of Tiancai Lake (a
    small treeline lake, SW China), in response to Holocene climate variations. Algal
    communities shifted from the dominance of cyanobacteria and cryptophytes in the
    early Holocene, towards siliceous algae in the mid-Holocene and chlorophytes in
    the late Holocene. Algae responded to a combination of climate-mediated vegetation
    and soil development associated with allochthonous inputs of dissolved nutrients
    and organic matter, and sediment infilling. Decreases in Al, Pb, Cu and Zn from
    the early Holocene probably resulted from soil podsolization and the sequestration
    of these elements within soils. Changes in Mn and Fe were likely linked to redox
    condition in catchment soils and water column. Synchronous peaks in Ti, Ba, Ca,
    Sr, Na, K and Mg, median grain size and magnetic susceptibility coincided with
    the troughs in the chemical index of alteration, indicating that episodic cold
    events enhanced upland bedrock erosion and transported unleached and coarse detritus
    into the lake. These cold events broadly correlate with Holocene ice-rafting events
    in the North Atlantic. Although the cold events altered the influx of minerogenic
    elements by regulating upland bedrock erosion, climate-mediated vegetation and
    soil development led to a muted impact on primary producers. Holocene algal community
    shifts were subtle, reflecting the relative abundance of P (derived from weathering)
    and N (derived from soils) throughout the record, with the most pronounced effects
    on the lake biota being benthic expansion which occurred in response to sediment
    infilling.
