  abstract: We determined the inventories of four anthropogenic trace elements, Pb,
    Zn, As, and Cd, and two radionuclides, 137Cs and excess 210Pb, in sediment cores
    collected from eight remote lakes in the Adirondack region of the northeastern
    United States. The inventories of all six substances vary considerably among the
    sediment cores, although the lakes and their associated catchments must have received
    similar cumulative per unit area atmospheric inputs of these substances. These
    variations are highly correlated, indicating that the trace elements and radionuclides
    are affected in a coherent way by the processes controlling their deposition to
    the sediments of these lakes. Assuming that the anthropogenic trace element inventories
    in each sediment core are enhanced or depleted relative to cumulative atmospheric
    deposition to the extent indicated by the sediment core inventories of either
    137Cs or excess 210Pb, we produced estimates of the cumulative atmospheric inputs
    of the four anthropogenic trace elements to this region. Comparison of the excess
    210Pb normalized anthropogenic Pb, Zn, Cd inventories of the Adirondack sediment
    cores with excess 210Pb normalized inventories of the same substances in a group
    of South Central Ontario lakes suggests that the Adirondack region has received
    greater cumulative anthropogenic inputs of Pb, Zn and Cd by a factor of 1.6, 4.5,
    and 2.9, respectively.
