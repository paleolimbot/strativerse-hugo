  abstract: Concentrations of arsenic in surface or near-surface sediment in 12 of
    13 cores from the three major basins of Loch Lomond are substantially enhanced,
    up to 675 mg/kg compared with background values of 15–50 mg/kg. Sedimentary As
    profiles are attributed to post-depositional enrichment processes since there
    are no recent significant sources of environmental As contamination, anthropogenic
    or natural, in the Loch Lomond area. The enrichments can be interpreted in terms
    of post-depositional diagenetic remobilization processes in sediment reducing
    zones, followed by upward migration of As through interstitial waters and oxidation/adsorption/precipitation
    reactions in near-surface oxidizing layers. Confirmation of the diagenetic/adsorption
    hypothesis is provided directly by the analysis of As species (1.5–81 μg/l) in
    pore water and indirectly via comparison with sedimentary phosphorus.
