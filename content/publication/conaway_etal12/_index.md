  abstract: 'Recent Lake Tanganyika Hg deposition records were derived using 14C and
    excess 210Pb geochronometers in sediment cores collected from two contrasting
    depositional environments: the Kalya Platform, located mid-lake and more removed
    from watershed impacts, and the Nyasanga/Kahama River delta region, located close
    to the lake’s shoreline north of Kigoma. At the Kalya Platform area, pre-industrial
    Hg concentrations are 23±0.2ng/g, increasing to 74ng/g in modern surface sediment,
    and the Hg accumulation rate has increased from 1.0 to 7.2μg/m2/a from pre-industrial
    to present, which overall represents a 6-fold increase in Hg concentration and
    accumulation. At the Nyasanga/Kahama delta region, pre-industrial Hg concentrations
    are 20±3ng/g, increasing to 46ng/g in surface sediment. Mercury accumulation rate
    has increased from 30 to 70μg/m2/a at this site, representing a 2–3-fold increase
    in Hg concentration and accumulation. There is a lack of correlation between charcoal
    abundance and Hg accumulation rate in the sediment cores, demonstrating that local
    biomass burning has little relationship with the observed Hg concentration or
    Hg accumulation rates. Examined using a sediment focusing-corrected mass accumulation
    rate approach, the cores have similar anthropogenic atmospheric Hg deposition
    profiles, suggesting that after accounting for background sediment concentrations
    the source of accumulating Hg is predominantly atmospheric in origin. In summary,
    the data document an increase of Hg flux to the Lake Tanganyika ecosystem that
    is consistent with increasing watershed sediment delivery with background-level
    Hg contamination, and regional as well as global increases in atmospheric Hg deposition.'
