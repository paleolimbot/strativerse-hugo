  abstract: 210Pb dating of a short Mackereth core, from a suite characterised previously
    by palaeomagnetic and radiocarbon dating, has been performed using both conventional
    radiochemical and particle track methods. The latter involves total α and U assay
    using plastic detectors and untreated sediment pellets. Sedimentation rates determined
    by the two techniques are in good agreement (∼22 mg cm−2 y−1), suggesting that
    the simpler particle track method has much to offer in routine sediment dating.
    The radiometric time scale is totally consistent with heavy metal profiles and
    the known industrial history of the surrounding area.
