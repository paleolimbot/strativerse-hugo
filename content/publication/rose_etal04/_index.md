  abstract: Twenty-one lakes along the west coast of Svalbard were cored between 28
    July and 14 August 1995. Five cores were 210Pb dated and analysed for spheroidal
    carbonaceous particles (SCPs), indicators of deposition from fossil-fuel combustion
    sources, and trace metals. Surface and pre-industrial levels of five cores were
    analysed for 10 polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) isomers and 16 polycyclic aromatic
    hydrocarbon (PAH) compounds, whilst all 21 surface sediments were analysed for
    SCPs. Temporal and spatial trends in the atmospheric deposition of pollutants
    were identified. Whilst temporal patterns of deposited pollutants may have been
    truncated due to concentrations falling below the limits of detection, spatial
    patterns showed elevated levels of SCP, PAH, PCB, and possibly Pb within 60â€“70
    km of Isfjord. Tenndammen (U), the closest site to Longyearbyen, showed the highest
    levels of contamination for all pollutants. Differences in the deposition patterns
    of PAH and PCB are thought to be due to local sources of PAH from coal combustion
    whilst PCB sources are remote. It is concluded that the impact from atmospheric
    deposition on Svalbard is due to a combination of spatially limited local sources
    superimposed on a broad-scale, long-range pattern.
