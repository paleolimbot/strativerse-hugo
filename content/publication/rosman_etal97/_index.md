  abstract: The pollution history of the atmosphere of the Northern Hemisphere is
    recorded in the levels of heavy metal impurities in Greenland ice. The possibility
    also exists of using natural variations in the abundances of lead isotopes to
    trace the source of this pollution. Lead isotopes have now been measured in ancient
    Greenland ice with a lead concentration as low as 0.9 pg/g. The results show a
    depression in the 206Pb/207Pb ratio between 600 B.C. and 300 A.D., giving unequivocal
    evidence of early large-scale atmospheric pollution by this toxic metal. This
    ratio changes from ∼1.201 in ∼8-kyr-old ice to ∼1.183 about 2 kyr ago. Isotopic
    systematics point to the mining districts in southwest and southeast Spain as
    the dominant sources of this lead, giving quantitative evidence of the importance
    of these mining districts to the Carthaginian and Roman civilizations. Lead with
    a Rio Tinto-type signature represents ∼70% of the lead found in Greenland ice
    between ∼150 B.C. and 50 A.D. after correcting for the contribution from rock
    dust indexed to aluminium concentrations.
