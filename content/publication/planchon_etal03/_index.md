  abstract: 'A record of the concentrations of Pb and Ba and the isotopic composition
    of Pb has been established for a remote, low accumulation site in the Atlantic
    sector of Antarctica (Coats Land) by means of thermal ionization mass spectrometry.
    The snow samples cover the period ∼1840 to 1990. They were taken from the walls
    of a pit to a depth of 7.8 m and as a core to 16 m; ultraclean procedures were
    used. Detailed laboratory subsampling provided both long-term (secular scale)
    and short-term (intra-annual) Pb, Ba, and Pb isotope variations. The results show
    that there have been significant variations in Pb concentrations (range, 0.1 to
    9.3 pg/g) and isotopic composition (range, 1.096 to 1.208 for 206Pb/207Pb ratio)
    since the 1840s. The data show evidence of pollution for this metal in Antarctica
    as early as the 1880s. Several Pb maxima were observed: the first at the beginning
    of the 20th century and the last in the 1970s to 1980s, with a clear decrease
    during recent years. Although the last maximum is clearly linked to the rise and
    fall in the use of leaded gasoline in the Southern Hemisphere, especially in South
    America, the reason for the first remains uncertain. The pattern of changing isotopic
    composition of Pb reveals the changing origin and character of the anthropogenic
    inputs to Antarctica. An interesting feature in this pattern is the relatively
    large contribution of unradiogenic Pb in the ∼1890s, possibly originating from
    Australia. Another interesting feature is the pronounced intra-annual variation
    in the isotopic composition of Pb, which illustrates the complexity of the changing
    inputs of Pb to Antarctica.'
