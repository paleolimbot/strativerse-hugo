  abstract: Surface samples and cores were collected in 1993 fromthe Burlington Harbor
    region of Lake Champlain. Sediment samples were analyzed for trace metals(cadmium,
    copper, lead, nickel, silver and zinc),simultaneously extracted metal/acid volatile
    sulfide(SEM-AVS), grain size, nutrients (carbon and nitrogen)and organic contaminants
    (polycyclic aromatichydrocarbons (PAHs) and polychlorinated biphenyls(PCBs)).
    The concentrations of cadmium, copper,silver and zinc from the partial sediment
    digestion ofthe surface samples correlated well with each other(r2>0.60) indicating
    that either a commonprocess, or group of processes determined the sedimentconcentrations
    of these metals. In an analysis of thespatial distribution of the trace metals
    and PAHs,high surficial concentrations were present in thesouthern portion of
    the Harbor. The trace metal trendwas strengthened when the concentrations werenormalized
    by grain size. A sewage treatment plantoutfall discharge was present in the southeasternportion
    of the Harbor at the time of this study and isthe major source of trace metal
    and PAH contamination. Evaluation of sediment cores provides a proxy recordof
    historical trace metal and organic inputs. Thepeak accumulation rate for copper,
    cadmium, lead, andzinc was in the late 1960s and the peak silveraccumulation rate
    was later. The greatestaccumulation of trace metals occurred in the late1960s
    after discharges from the STP began. Subsequentdeclines in trace metal concentrations
    may beattributed to increased water and air regulations. The potential toxicity
    of trace metals and organiccontaminants was predicted by comparing contaminantconcentrations
    to benchmark concentrations andpotential trace metal bioavailability was predictedwith
    SEM-AVS results. Surface sample results indicate lead,silver, ΣPAHs and ΣPCBs
    are potentially toxicand/or bioavailable. These predictions were supportedby studies
    of biota in the Burlington Harborwatershed. There is a clear trend of decreasing
    PAHand trace metal contaminant concentrations withdistance from the STP outfall.
