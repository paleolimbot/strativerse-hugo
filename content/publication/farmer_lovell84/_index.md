  abstract: Extremely high Mn levels of up to 9.1% have been found in sections of
    surface or near‐surface sediment in Loch Lomond. The enriched Mn levels, amongst
    the highest recorded for freshwater lake sediments, are attributable to post‐depositional
    diagenetic processes which have also influenced sedimentary Fe and As profiles.
    Although discrete ferromanganese nodules were not found, thin crusts composed
    of distinct high ‐ Mn and ‐ Fe layers covered parts of the loch bottom.
