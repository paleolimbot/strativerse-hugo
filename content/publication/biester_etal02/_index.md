  abstract: Increasing mercury deposition rates in the Northern Hemisphere recorded
    in natural archives such as peat bogs or lake sediments have been documented in
    numerous studies. However, data on atmospheric Hg deposition in the Southern Hemisphere
    dating back to pre-industrial times are rare. Here, we provide a continuous record
    of atmospheric Hg deposition in the Southern Hemisphere recorded by an ombrotrophic
    peat bog of the Magellanic Moorlands, Chile (53°S), extending back 3000 yr. Pre-industrial
    mercury accumulation rates range between 2.5 and 3.9 μg/m2/yr. In the past 100
    yr, Hg accumulation rates increased 18-fold from about 3 μg/m2/yr to a maximum
    of 62.5 μg/m2/yr. If Hg accumulation rates were normalized to peat accumulation
    rates, maximum rates were 7.9 μg/m2/yr, which is only 2.5 times the pre-industrial
    rates. Thus, Hg accumulation rates normalized to peat accumulation rates are more
    comparable to the three-fold net increase in atmospheric Hg concentrations estimated
    for the same period. We suggest that the increase in Hg accumulation rates in
    the Magellanic Moorlands within the past 100 yr is at least partly attributed
    to global dispersion of Hg derived from anthropogenic sources in the Northern
    Hemisphere. The finding that no increase of atmospheric deposition of Pb could
    be observed in the bog indicates the extraordinary long-range transport and ubiquitous
    dispersion of anthropogenic derived gaseous Hg compared to other metals.
