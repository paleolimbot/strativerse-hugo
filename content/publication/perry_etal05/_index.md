  abstract: 'Total atmospheric contribution of mercury (HgT) to lake sediment was
    estimated using 210Pb-dated sediment cores. Algorithms based on estimates of lake
    and watershed processes were applied to more accurately assess anthropogenic contributions
    of Hg to the environment and HgT. Factors addressed include: lake-specific background
    accumulation rates of Hg (HgB), variability of sediment accumulation rates that
    caused variation in Hg accumulation during the last 100–150 years (HgV), and variable
    flux of anthropogenic Hg from the atmosphere (HgA). These fluxes were normalized
    for sediment focusing using a regional, unsupported 210Pb correction factor to
    yield HgA,F. Time series maps of HgA,F allow for comparison across time and space,
    and are provided for 1900, 1950, 1975 and 1990 across eastern New York and New
    England, USA. Deconstruction algorithms reduce inter-/intra-lake variability in
    Hg accumulation rates and improve temporal coherence. HgA,F started to increase
    near the end of the 19th century to a maximum between 1970 and 1990, depending
    on the lake. Maximum HgT across the region ranges from 27.1 to 175 μg/m2 year.
    Maximum HgA,F ranged from 10.4 to 66.3 μg/m2 year. The timing of HgA,F declines
    in response to decreased atmospheric deposition may be controlled by in-lake and
    in-watershed storage and transport of Hg-bearing sediment.'
