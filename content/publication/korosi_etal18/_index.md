  abstract: Recent climate change may be enhancing mercury fluxes to Arctic lake sediments,
    confounding the use of sediment cores to reconstruct histories of atmospheric
    deposition. Assessing the independent effects of climate warming on mercury sequestration
    is challenging due to temporal overlap between warming temperatures and increased
    long-range transport of atmospheric mercury following the Industrial Revolution.
    We address this challenge by examining mercury trends in short cores (the last
    several hundred years) from eight lakes centered on Cape Herschel (Canadian High
    Arctic) that span a gradient in microclimates, including two lakes that have not
    yet been significantly altered by climate warming due to continued ice cover.
    Previous research on subfossil diatoms and inferred primary production indicated
    the timing of limnological responses to climate warming, which, due to prevailing
    ice cover conditions, varied from ∼1850 to ∼1990 for lakes that have undergone
    changes. We show that climate warming may have enhanced mercury deposition to
    lake sediments in one lake (Moraine Pond), while another (West Lake) showed a
    strong signal of post-industrial mercury enrichment without any corresponding
    limnological changes associated with warming. Our results provide insights into
    the role of climate warming and organic carbon cycling as drivers of mercury deposition
    to Arctic lake sediments.
