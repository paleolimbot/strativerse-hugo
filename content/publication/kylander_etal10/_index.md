  abstract: Stable lead (Pb) isotope data from pre-contamination peat sections has
    the potential to contribute to our understanding of earth system processes (e.g.,
    atmospheric circulation, erosion, and volcanic activity) in the past. Key questions
    arise however. Can the Pb isotopes archived in peat records be used for assessing
    aerosol dynamics on a hemispheric scale or do they mainly reflect inputs from
    local soils? What natural Pb sources are important and do contributions vary over
    time? In order to answer these questions we have synthesized all available Pb
    isotope data from pre-contamination peat sections in Europe, North America, South
    America and Australia. We specifically examine the spatial and temporal variability
    of the Pb isotope records and identify regionally important trends and Pb sources.
    A pooling of all available pre-contamination peat data generated an average natural
    206Pb/207Pb background ratio of 1.21±0.05 (2σ, n=300) (206Pb/204Pb=18.90±0.86,
    207Pb/204Pb=15.66±0.10 and 208Pb/204Pb=38.74±0.57, n=207). The majority of the
    records showed limited temporal and compositional agreement, suggesting that the
    peat record receives mainly inputs from local (<10km) and/or regional (10–500km)
    sources. Three-isotope plots also support local and regional control and evidence
    a wide natural spread at some sites, particularly those located in radiogenic
    geological settings. A temporally synchronous isotope excursion to values between
    1.16 and 1.18 at sites across Europe ca 4000–3000B.C. was detected, however. While
    usually associated with anthropogenic sources, there are indeed natural aerosols
    having 206Pb/207Pb signatures as low as 1.16 as evidenced in several peat and
    ice core records globally. Three-isotope plots suggest that this unlikely to be
    a signal of mineral dust contributions, which tend to have 206Pb/207Pb ratios
    ≥1.19, but rather can be sourced to volcanic emissions. These results stress caution
    when using estimates of the upper continental crust to constrain natural Pb sources
    in, e.g., mixing equations. Considering the strong influence from local and regional
    sources on Pb-containing aerosols in the peat record, the assessment of aerosol
    dynamics at lower latitudes is likely best achieved using a compliment of archives.
