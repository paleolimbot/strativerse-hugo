  abstract: The depth-distribution of lead and its stable isotope ratios were determined
    in a dated sediment core from a Canadian Shield lake receiving anthropogenic Pb
    inputs exclusively from atmospheric deposition. The results demonstrate that anthropogenic
    Pb deposited to the sediments of this lake since the preindustrial period can
    be modeled successfully using as little as two isotopically distinct Pb types.
    The first, whose flux was not detectable before 1850, reached a maximum value
    around 1950, and then decreased significantly thereafter; it was characterized
    by 206Pb/207Pb and 206Pb/208Pb ratios of 1.222 and 0.495, respectively, and was
    derived mainly from coal combustion. The second, whose flux was not detectable
    before 1880, increased sharply to exceed that of the Pb type derived from coal
    combustion around 1930, and reached a maximum in the mid 1970s; it is characterized
    by 206Pb/207Pb and 206Pb/208Pb ratios of 1.179 and 0.482, respectively, and was
    derived mainly from leaded gasoline combustion and industrial sources. The chronology
    of deposition of these two anthropogenic lead types agrees well with the historical
    records of fossil fuel uses in Canada and the USA, and also with the history of
    sediment-deposited polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) originating from coal
    combustion. The inventory of Pb derived from coal combustion (0.09 μmol cm−2)
    is ∼30% of that derived mainly, but not exclusively, from leaded gasoline (0.31
    μmol cm−2). Apportionment among source regions of lead deposited to the sediments
    during the period when leaded gasoline dominated Pb atmospheric emissions indicates
    that ∼50% of this lead originated in the USA.
