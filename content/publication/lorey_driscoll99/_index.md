  abstract: There is interest in historical patterns of total mercury (HgT) deposition
    because of concern over contamination to remote lakes by atmospheric Hg deposition.
    Sediment cores were collected from eight remote lakes in the Adirondack region
    of New York. Concentration and flux profiles were reconstructed from preindustrial
    to modern values based on 210Pb dating. All cores exhibited an increase in HgT
    since 1850. The ratio of modern HgT flux to preindustrial HgT flux in sediments
    ranged from 1.6 to 5.7, with an average value of 3.5. The lake cores showed an
    increase in sediment HgT flux with increasing ratio of watershed area to lake
    surface area. Our analysis suggests that in 1850 Adirondack watersheds retained
    95% of atmospheric deposition of Hg. This fraction has decreased since about 1930
    to 78% currently, a value that agrees with watershed mass balance studies. Extrapolation
    of the relationship between sediment HgT flux and watershed area to lake surface
    area to a value of 1 suggests that the flux of atmospheric HgT deposition was
    5.0 μg m-2 yr-1 in preindustrial times and is 8.9 μg m-2 yr-1 currently. This
    modern estimate of Hg deposition to lake sediments is somewhat lower (∼36%) than
    direct estimates of atmospheric HgT deposition.
