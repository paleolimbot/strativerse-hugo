  abstract: Concentration profiles of Mg, K, La, Fe, Mn, V, Cr, As and Mo were determined
    in samples from a freeze core taken at the deepest site of Baldeggersee in 1993.
    The special coring technique allowed an exact dating of the sediment samples and
    an annual resolution of the profiles. Long term changes in benthic redox conditions
    produce diagnostic trends in several metal profiles. Fe, As and Mn enrichments
    trace the onset of anoxia at the deepest site of the lake. High values of Mo concentrations
    and Cr/V ratios indicate periods of stable anoxic conditions in a meromictic hypolimnion.
    A comparison of oxygen time series with metal profiles between 1950 and 1990 indicates
    that Mn reacts sensitively to large seasonal variations of deep-water oxygen concentrations.
