  abstract: A full understanding of the atmospheric Pb cycle in Asia during the Holocene
    is key to palaeoclimate studies of past atmospheric circulation patterns, as well
    as to assess the impact of increasing industrial activities in this region. However,
    long-term records of atmospheric Pb isotopic trends in Asia are still sparse.
    Consequently, we study changes in the concentrations, fluxes and isotopic signature
    of deposited Pb contained in a 14C-dated peat core from the eastern Qinghai–Tibetan
    Plateau, dating back to 9.5kyr BP, and present the first peat record of the changing
    isotopic composition of atmospheric Pb in dust in Asia during this time. Lead
    concentrations and fluxes vary between 2.96–21.58μgg−1 and 0.06–3.52mgm−2y−1,
    respectively, with an average Pb baseline of 6.80±4.18μgg−1. These values agree
    with other Pb studies of lake and peat archives in China but are one order of
    magnitude larger than early and mid-Holocene values measured in Europe. Lead isotopic
    variability throughout the core is small, varying between 206Pb/207Pb=1.190–1.197,
    206Pb/204Pb=18.648–18.786, 207Pb/204Pb=15.666–15.694 and 208Pb/204Pb=38.890–39.090.
    The application of Bayesian trans-dimensional changepoint modelling to the Pb
    dataset enabled the identification of eight significant changes in the isotopic
    composition of the deposited Pb. Such changes mark different phases of atmospheric
    Pb deposition, and hence variations in atmospheric circulation patterns and environmental
    conditions. Temporal variations in the potential natural and/or anthropogenic
    Pb sources are assessed based on the 206Pb, 207Pb, 208Pb and 204Pb isotopic composition
    and the 1/[Pb] ratio of the peat samples. Our results suggest that Pb deposition
    throughout the Holocene was governed by local deposition and long-range input
    from natural dust sources in northwestern (Taklamakan desert and Qaidam basin)
    and northern China (Badain Jaran and Tengger deserts). Input from the northern
    sources seems to have been particularly important between 3.1–2.7kyr BP and 1.7–0.9kyr
    BP, suggesting a possible strengthening of the East Asian winter monsoon, in agreement
    with previous reconstructions in Asia. Based on the Pb/Sc and isotopic composition
    profiles we do not note any evidence for anthropogenic Pb derived from the thriving
    mining or smelting activities in northern and eastern China in the last few millennia,
    suggesting that atmospheric deposition to this region of the eastern Tibetan Plateau
    was dominated by natural Pb fluxes. These can serve as a true Asian “background”
    value against which anthropogenic impacts can be quantified. Our results confirm
    that the combination of radiogenic isotopes (Pb) and trace elements in peat bogs
    enables observational reconstructions of changes in past regional atmospheric
    circulation. Such records will enable more refined interpretations of marine and
    terrestrial palaeorecords in Asia and the Pacific and consequently provide further
    constraints for changes in ocean and atmospheric circulation and for the testing
    of palaeoclimate models of circulation patterns.
