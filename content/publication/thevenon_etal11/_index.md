  abstract: This research first focuses on the spatial and temporal patterns of heavy
    metals from contrasting environments (highly polluted to deepwater sites) of Lake
    Geneva. The mercury (Hg) and lead (Pb) records from two deepwater sites show that
    the heavy metal variations before the industrial period are primarily linked to
    natural weathering input of trace elements. By opposition, the discharge of industrial
    treated wastewaters into Vidy Bay of Lake Geneva during the second part of the
    20th century, involved the sedimentation of highly metal-contaminated sediments
    in the area surrounding the WWTP outlet pipe discharge. Eventually, a new Pb isotope
    record of sediments from Lake Lucerne identifies the long-term increasing anthropogenic
    lead pollution after ca. 1500, probably due to the development of metallurgical
    activities during the High Middle Ages. These data furthermore allows to compare
    the recent anthropogenic sources of water pollution from three of the largest
    freshwater lakes of Western Europe (lakes Geneva, Lucerne, and Constance). High
    increases in Pb and Hg highlight the regional impact of industrial pollution after
    ca. 1750–1850, and the decrease of metal pollution in the 1980s due to the effects
    of remediation strategies such as the implementation of wastewater treatment plants
    (WWTPs). However, at all the studied sites, the recent metal concentrations remain
    higher than pre-industrial levels. Moreover, the local scale pollution data reveal
    two highly contaminated sites (>100μg Pb/g dry weight sediment) by industrial
    activities, during the late-19th and early-20th centuries (Lake Lucerne) and during
    the second part of the 20th century (Vidy Bay of Lake Geneva). Overall, the regional
    scale pollution history inferred from the three large and deep perialpine lakes
    points out at the pollution of water systems by heavy metals during the last two
    centuries due to the discharge of industrial effluents.
