  abstract: To advance the understanding of sediment distribution, catchment weathering,
    hydraulic sorting, and sediment provenance in a tectonically stable basin, the
    geochemistry of surface sediment samples from Daihai Lake in north China is presented.
    Mud bulk sediments were analyzed for 10 major and 30 trace elements, organic carbon,
    and nitrogen and for 87Sr/86Sr ratios in silicate fraction (acid insoluble, AI)
    and carbonates (acid soluble, AS). Enrichment in Fe2O3, CaO, MnO, MgO, K2O, and
    P2O5 and their positive correlation with Al2O3, Rb/Sr ratios, and bivariate discrimination
    diagrams of K vs. Rb and Th/U vs. Th suggest low chemical weathering intensity
    under semiarid conditions in the Daihai catchment. Accumulation of clays in deeper
    water sites by sedimentary sorting results in an evident distribution of sediment
    composition with the lake water depth. Although similar chondrite-normalized REE
    (rare earth element) patterns of lake sediment samples (with LREE (light rare
    earth element) enrichment, negative Eu anomalies, and an almost flat HREE (heavy
    rare earth element) pattern) may suggest similar sedimentary source rocks, original
    sediment provenance can be recognized on the basis of their distinctive 87Sr/86Sr
    (AI) ratios and immobile (Th, Zr, Ti, and Nb) trace element signature, separating
    from weathering and sedimentary processes as well as from grain size effect.
