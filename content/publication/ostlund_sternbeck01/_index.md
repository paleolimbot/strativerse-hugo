  abstract: Lead (Pb) in the environment is derived from both naturaland anthropogenic
    sources. The aim of this study is to estimate the isotopic signature of anthropogenic
    Pb in sediments from a highly contaminated area (Stockholm), to discuss the influence
    of different sources on this signature, and to suggest natural Pb background concentrations.
    Also distribution patterns and differences between different water areas in Stockholm
    have been studied, both by total Pb and stable Pb isotopes. In 1993, sediment
    samples were collected at 24 stations in the Stockholm area and analysed for total
    Pb, zirconium (Zr), scandium (Sc) and stable Pb isotopes (204, 206-208Pb). Total
    Pb data show that the Stockholm sediments are severely contaminated by Pb. The
    contamination seems to be rather local since the small lakes surrounding the central
    parts of Stockholm are much less effected than the central parts. Stockholm is
    clearly influenced by anthropogenic and natural sources, but in some of the small
    lakes also by Pb in zircons from the geological basement. The anthropogenic Pb
    in Stockholm has typical 207Pb/206Pb ratios of 0.85–0.89 and 208Pb/204Pb ratios
    of 36–38, which are distinct from natural sources. Pb/Sc ratios suggest that the
    natural background Pb concentration is 10–20 mg kg-1 d.w.
