  abstract: Preserved layers of snow deposited between 1960 and 1988, taken from 10.7
    m and 70 m snow cores drilled at Summit in central Greenland in 1989, were analyzed
    for lead isotopes (206Pb207Pb, 208Pb207Pb, and 206Pb204Pb). The lead has an isotopic
    composition consistent with a mixture of USA and Eurasian origins. Although the
    206Pb207Pb ratio fluctuates, presumably due to seasonal changes in the weather
    patterns, there is a clear trend in values from about 1.16 in the early 1960s
    to 1.18 by 1976, then back to the initial value by the mid 1980s. The initial
    trend upwards reflects the progressive introduction of relatively radiogenic Mississippi
    Valley-type lead into USA gasoline during the 1960s, while the return to lower
    values indicates a decreased contribution from this source due to the switch to
    unleaded gasoline for motor vehicles. Eurasian lead, assumed to be the second
    component of the mixture, appears to have a relatively constant 206Pb207Pb ratio
    over this period.
