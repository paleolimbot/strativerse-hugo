  abstract: Sediments in wetlands and lakes have the potential to retain metals that
    have been mobilized by natural and anthropogenic disturbance. The role of variable
    water column chemistry and nutrient loads on metal retention and mobility in wetland
    and lake sediments is not well understood. Laytons Lake is a coastal freshwater
    lake located in the Amherst Point Migratory Bird Sanctuary in Nova Scotia, Canada.
    It experienced a series of marine inundations from the Bay of Fundy in the 1940s.
    In the late 1970s, researchers identified that the lake was density stratified
    and incompletely mixed (meromictic), which resulted in a strong chemocline and
    elevated conductivity levels within 3m of lake bottom sediments. A detailed paleolimnological
    assessment was undertaken to investigate the geochemical impact of meromixis on
    lake bottom sediment geochemistry, and the rate of transition from a meromictic
    to an intermixing state. A geochemical analysis of lake bottom sediments was accomplished
    by measuring total C, N and stable isotopes (δ15N, and δ13C), and using pXRF to
    measure elemental proxies. A total Pb curve was used to date the sediment coretemporally.
    It appears that Laytons Lake is no longer density stratified. A distinct chemoclineno
    longer exists, as only a small concentration of conductivity (1012 μScm) was detected
    at the bottom of the deep basin. Data from this study suggests that the lake recovered
    rapidly from the marine inundation and that meromixis had a very limited effect
    on the bulk geochemistry of the sediment archive. C/N ratios suggest that the
    organic matter found in the lake bottom sediment is largely from terrestrial source.
    This study demonstrated that in a macrotidal environment, the water and sediment
    chemistry of low-lying coastal lakes may be much more variable and dynamic than
    lakes situated farther inland, away from occasional marine inundation.
