  abstract: SummaryCivilisational accumulations of heavy metals during the last decades
    have been studied from dated sedimentary cores from Lake Constance and Tegernsee.
    Similar trends in both zinc/lead-concentrations and nitrogen/phosphor-data (Hamm,
    1971;Wagner, 1972) indicate that these substances all originate within the public
    sewage system, whereas the increase of cadmium and chromium within the upper part
    of the Lake Constance sediments can be explained by industrial emmissions. This
    is backed up by the results of investigations conducted on fine-grained sediments
    from tributaries of Lake Constance.The strong increase of manganese in the uppermost
    sediment layer of central Lake Constance probably is caused by dissolution of
    manganese within the lower reducing part of the core and subsequent precipitation
    in the oxidative surface zone.
