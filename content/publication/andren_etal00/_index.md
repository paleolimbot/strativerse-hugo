  abstract: Sediment cores from the Gotland Basin were studied for their siliceous
    microfossil assemblages and organic carbon content to compare recent environmental
    changes in the Baltic Sea with its natural long-term history. Age models were
    constructed using 210Pb, 137Cs and corrected and calibrated 14C dates. The transgression
    that marks the onset of the Ancylus Lake stage is recorded in the sediments as
    a small increase in organic carbon coinciding with a peak in diatom abundance
    and increased diatom diversity. A minor occurrence of brackish-freshwater diatoms
    is recorded in the Ancylus Lake c. 9950–9750 cal. yr BP (c. 8900–8800 14C yr BP),
    correlating with the onset of the Initial Litorina Sea in the Bornholm Basin.
    A high-productivity event is recorded in the end of the Post-Litorina Sea and
    corresponds to the Mediaeval warm event. An alteration in the diatom assemblage
    contemporaneous with a decrease in organic carbon, interpreted as representing
    a deterioration in the climate, correlates with the start of the ‘Little Ice Age’
    about 850–700 cal. yr BP. A change dated to ad 1950–1960 is probably an effect
    of increased nutrient availability in the open Baltic Sea. This effect of eutrophication
    was probably caused by increased discharge of nutrients deriving from fertilizers,
    as the responding diatom species partly indicate a cold climate rather than a
    warm one, as would have been expected if this had been only a response to the
    warmer climate documented during the last 100 years or so.
