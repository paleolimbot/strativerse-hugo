  abstract: Urban settings are a focal point for environmental contamination due to
    emissions from industrial and municipal activities and the widespread use of motor
    vehicles. As part of the National Water-Quality Assessment Program of the U.S.
    Geological Survey, streambed-sediment and dated reservoir-sediment samples were
    collected from the Chattahoochee River Basin and analyzed for total lead (Pb)
    and zinc (Zn) concentrations. The sampling transect extends from northern Georgia,
    through Atlanta, to the Gulf of Mexico and reflects a steep gradient in population
    density from nearly 1000 people/km2 in the Atlanta Metropolitan Area to fewer
    than 50 people/km2 in rural areas of southern Georgia and northern Florida. Correlations
    among population density, traffic density, and total and anthropogenic Pb and
    Zn concentrations indicate that population density is strongly related to traffic
    density and is a predictor of Pb and Zn concentrations in the environment derived
    from anthropogenic activities. Differences in the distributions of total Pb and
    Zn concentrations along the urban−suburban−rural gradient from Atlanta to the
    Florida Panhandle are related to temporal and spatial processes. That is, with
    the removal of leaded gasoline starting in the late 1970s, peak Pb concentrations
    have decreased to the present. Conversely, increased vehicular usage has kept
    Zn concentrations elevated in runoff from population centers, which is reflected
    in the continued enrichment of Zn in aquatic sediments. Sediments from rural areas
    also contain elevated concentrations of Zn, possibly in response to substantial
    power plant emissions for the region, as well as vehicular traffic.
