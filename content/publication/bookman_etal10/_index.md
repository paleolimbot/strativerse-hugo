  abstract: Geochemical analysis of 210Pb-dated sediment cores from Otisco Lake (New
    York) combined with analysis of recent land cover change in the watershed revealed
    the history of land use change, lake management, and industrial pollution since
    European settlement in the northeastern US. Clearance of forestland for agriculture
    characterized the early settlement era that was marked in the Otisco Lake sediments
    by a decline in organic carbon (OC) and OC:N ratios, which indicate a change in
    the sources of organic matter to the lake. Agricultural land use reached its greatest
    areal extent in the Otisco watershed around 1900, followed by field abandonment
    and reforestation over the last century. In the 1920s sediment accumulation rates
    began to increase coincident with residential development along the lake shore.
    Nitrogen and organic carbon, which are transported from the watershed, show increased
    fluxes to the lake in response to this change. Deposition of inorganic carbon
    increased markedly over a short period from the 1940s to the 1980s, which is consistent
    with enhanced mobilization of watershed calcium by increased acidic deposition,
    followed by alkalinization of the lake waters and calcite precipitation. An increase
    in copper content in the sediments reflects application, since 1942, of the algicide
    copper sulfate to the lake waters to control algal blooms. This CuSO4 marker confirmed
    the accuracy of the 210Pb chronology. Atmospheric mercury (Hg) fluxes to the lake
    were affected by increased sediment transport from the watershed. The maximum
    Hg peak in the sediment record, however, was dated to the early 1970s and coincides
    with maximum Hg emissions to the atmosphere in the Great Lakes region.
