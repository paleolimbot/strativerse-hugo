  abstract: Relations between urbanization and particle-associated contaminants in
    New England were evaluated using a combination of samples from sediment cores,
    streambed sediments, and suspended stream sediments. Concentrations of PAHs, PCBs,
    DDT, and seven trace metals (Cd, Cr, Cu, Hg, Ni, Pb, Zn) were correlated strongly
    with urbanization, with the strongest relations to percentage commercial, industrial,
    and transportation (CIT) land use. Average PAH and metal concentrations in the
    most urbanized watersheds were approximately 30 and 6 times the reference concentrations,
    respectively, in remote, undeveloped watersheds. One-quarter to one-half of sampling
    sites had concentrations of PAHs, Cu, Pb, or Zn above the probable effects concentration,
    a set of sediment quality guidelines for adverse effects to aquatic biota, and
    sediments were predicted to be toxic, on average, when CIT land use exceeded about
    10%. Trends in metals in cores from urban watersheds were dominantly downward,
    whereas trends in PAHs in a suburban watershed were upward. A regional atmospheric-fallout
    gradient was indicated by as much as order-of-magnitude-greater concentrations
    and accumulation rates of contaminants in cores from an undeveloped reference
    lake in Boston compared to those from remote reference watersheds. Contaminant
    accumulation rates in the lakes with urbanization in their watersheds, however,
    were 1â€“3 orders of magnitude greater than those of reference lakes, which indicate
    the dominance of local sources and fluvial transport of contaminants to urban
    lakes. These analyses demonstrate the magnitude of urban contamination of aquatic
    systems and air sheds, and suggest that, despite reductions in contaminant emissions
    in urban settings, streams and lakes will decline in quality as urbanization of
    their watersheds takes place.
