  abstract: 'A 157-cm-long sediment core from Longemer Lake in the Vosges Mountains
    of France spans the past two millennia and was analyzed for trace metal content
    and lead isotope composition. Trace metal accumulation rates highlight three main
    input phases: Roman Times (cal. 100 BC–AD 400), the Middle Ages (cal. AD 1000–1500),
    and the twentieth century. Atmospheric contamination displays a pattern that is
    similar to that seen in peat bogs from the region, at least until the eighteenth
    century. Thereafter, the lake sediment record is more precise than peat records.
    Some regional mining activity, such as that in archaeologically identified eighteenth-century
    mining districts, was detected from the lead isotope composition of sediment samples.
    Compositional data analysis, using six trace metals (silver, arsenic, cadmium,
    copper, lead and zinc), enabled us to distinguish between background conditions,
    periods of mining, and of other anthropogenic trace metal emissions, such as the
    recent use of leaded gasoline.'
