  abstract: The anthropogenic stable lead content of the sediments of eight softwater
    Precambrian lakes in southern Ontario was measured at 34–92 sites per lake. Whole-lake
    anthropogenic lead burdens varied between only 610 and 770 mg m−2. There was no
    relationship between lead burden and either water replenishment time of the lake
    (TW) or the ratio of watershed area to lake area (Ad/A0), which varied by factors
    of 4 and 12 respectively. These results can be explained if a) the lead deposition
    in this region is uniform, and b) the only significant input of lead to the lakes
    is via deposition from the atmosphere directly on the lakes' surfaces. Therefore
    spatial differences in anthropogenic lead within a lake represent the redistribution
    or focusing pattern of the sediments.
