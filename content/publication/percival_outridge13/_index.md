  abstract: Lake sediments are valuable archives of atmospheric metal deposition,
    but the stability of some element profiles may possibly be affected by diagenetic
    changes over time. In this extensive case study, the stability of sedimentary
    Cd, Cu, Hg, Pb and Zn profiles was assessed in dated sediment cores that were
    collected in 2004 from four smelter-affected lakes near Flin Flon, Manitoba, which
    had previously been cored in 1985. Metal profiles determined in 1985 were in most
    cases clearly reproduced in the corresponding sediment layers in 2004, although
    small-scale spatial heterogeneity in metal distribution complicated the temporal
    comparisons. Pre-smelter (i.e. pre-1930) increases in metal profiles were likely
    the result of long-range atmospheric metal pollution, coupled with particle mixing
    at the 1930s sediment surface. However, the close agreement between key inflection
    points in the metal profiles sampled two decades apart suggests that metals in
    most of the lakes, and Hg and Zn in the most contaminated lake (Meridian), were
    stable once the sediments were buried below the surface mixed layer. Cadmium,
    Cu and Pb profiles in Meridian Lake did not agree as well between studies, showing
    evidence of upward remobilization over time. Profiles of redox-indicator elements
    (Fe, Mn, Mo and U) suggested that the rate of Mn oxyhydroxide recycling within
    sediment was more rapid in Meridian Lake, which may have caused the Cd, Cu and
    Pb redistribution.
