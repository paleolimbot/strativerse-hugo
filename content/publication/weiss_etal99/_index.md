  abstract: Atmospheric Pb deposition since the Industrial Revolution was studied
    in western, central, and southern Switzerland using five rural peat bogs. Similar
    temporal patterns were found in western and central Switzerland, with two distinct
    periods of Pb enrichment relative to the natural background:  between 1880 and
    1920 with enrichments ranging from 40 to 80 times, and between 1960 and 1980 with
    enrichments ranging from 80 to 100 times. The fluxes also were generally elevated
    in those time periods:  in western Switzerland between 1.16 and 1.55 μg cm-2 y-1
    during the first period, and in western and central Switzerland between 0.85 and
    1.55 μg cm-2 y-1 during the second period. Between the Industrial Revolution and
    1985, nonradiogenic Pb became increasingly important in all five cores because
    of the replacement of coal by oil after ca. 1920, the use of Australian Pb in
    industry, and the extensive combustion of leaded gasoline after 1950. The introduction
    of unleaded gasoline in 1985 had a pronounced effect on the Pb deposition in all
    five cores. Enrichments dropped sharply (between 2 and 4 times), and the isotopic
    ratios reverted back toward (but not achieving) natural values. The cores from
    western and central Switzerland showed very similar isotopic trends throughout
    the time period studied, implying that these sites were influenced contemporaneously
    by similar pollution sources and atmospheric pathways. Southern Switzerland revealed
    a different record with respect to the Pb pollution:  it was dominated by a single
    massive Pb enrichment dated between 1930 and 1950. During this period the Pb enrichment
    factor reached ∼200 times background and the Pb flux was ∼27 μg cm-2 y-1, more
    than an order of magnitude higher that at the western and central sites. This
    core also had significantly different post-1950 changes in the Pb isotope ratios.
