  abstract: Long-term trends of atmospheric compositions are significant for assessing
    the influence of human activities on the atmosphere and protecting the atmospheric
    environment. In this study, based on heavy metal concentrations and Pb isotope
    ratios in a well-dated sediment core from a remote alpine lake in central North
    China, anthropogenic fluxes of As, Cd, Sb, and Pb were reconstructed and heavy
    metal evolutions in the atmosphere were revealed in the last 200 years. The heavy
    metals in the atmosphere were generally natural origins before 1980 A.D. Since
    the 1980s they began to increase gradually, but they increased the most in the
    1990s resulting from rapid developments of rough and high energy-consuming industries
    in North China. After entering the 21st century the industries still developed
    rapidly, but the atmospheric Pb ceased increase and the As and Sb even decreased
    in the 2000s due to (1) phasing out of leaded gasoline and (2) implementing stricter
    industrial emission standards in 2000 A.D. in China. However, in the 2000s the
    atmospheric heavy metals still kept at a relatively high level and even likely
    began to increase again in the 2010s. Considering the lake relatively remote and
    seldom affected by local human activities, the results likely reflect heavy metal
    evolutions in the regional background atmosphere of central North China at the
    annual/decadal timescale in the last 200 years.
