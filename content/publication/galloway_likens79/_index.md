  abstract: Sediment cores were collected from Woodhull Lake (Adirondack State Park,
    New York) in July 1975. Of 44 metals analyzed by neutron activation and atomic
    absorption spectrophotometry, 9 (Ag, Au, Cd, Cr, Cu, Pb, Sb, V, and Zn) showed
    increased rates of deposition in the last 30 years. These increases are attributed
    to increased rates of atmospheric deposition. Similar results were obtained from
    cores of Honnedaga Lake (Adirondack State Park, New York) and Lake of the Clouds
    (Mt. Washington, New Hampshire).
