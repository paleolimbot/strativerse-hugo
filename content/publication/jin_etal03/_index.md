  abstract: The87Sr/86Sr ratios of silicate (acid-insoluble, AI) and carbonate (acid-soluble,
    AS) of the lake sediments from the Daihai Lake, Inner Mongolia, since the last
    500 years are measured respectively, indicating that chemical weathering of silicate
    minerals was in an early stage since the Little Ice Age within the Daihai watershed
    by combination with mineral constitute, Rb/Sr ratio and CaCO3 content in the sediments.
    During the Little Ice Age maximum, an evident peak in the87Sr/86Sr ratios of both
    silicate and carbonate in sediments suggests that a cold climate condition is
    unfavorable to dissolving radiogenic strontium from silicate minerals. Meanwhile,
    the variation of87Sr/86Sr ratios of silicate and carbonate also reflects a projected
    warming climate favorable to intensifying chemical weathering after the Little
    Ice Age. Consequently, the87Sr/86Sr ratio of both silicate and carbonate in inland
    lake sediments can be used as an effective proxy of the past climate in single
    watershed.
