  abstract: Lead concentrations were measured in sediment cores from four sites distributed
    among the three major sedimentary basins — Niagara, Mississauga and Rochester
    — of Lake Ontario for which sedimentation rates had been previously determined
    by 210Pb dating. Around 90% of the total lead present in fine-grained surface
    sediments was removed by CH3CO2H/NH2OH · HCl leaching, concentrations ranging
    from 137 μg/g in surface sections to a constant background of 12–13 μg/g at unpolluted
    depths. Lead-210 dating indicated that increases in lead concentrations commenced
    ca. 1850–1875 with 5, 10, 35 and 50% of the total “excess” lead inventory in the
    sediment column being assigned to the pre-1900 period and successive 25-year intervals
    during the 20th Century, respectively. Anthropogenic inputs of lead from such
    sources as the combustion of leaded gasoline and coal are responsible for these
    increases. About 10 μg/g lead remained in the sediment residue after leaching.
    The total natural lead flux to the sediments ranged from 0.4–1.3 μg/cm2/yr while
    “excess” lead of anthropogenic origin varied from 1.2–6.7 μg/cm2/yr and totalled
    0.5–1.5 g/m2 at the four sites. Various potential modes of introduction of anthropogenic
    lead and of 210Pb to the lake are considered in conjunction with the ratio of
    Pb/210Pb fluxes to the sediment.
