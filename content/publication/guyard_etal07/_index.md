  abstract: Two twin short gravity cores and a long piston core recovered from the
    deepest part of proglacial Lake Bramant (Grandes Rousses Massif, French Alps),
    under and overlying a large slump identified by high-resolution seismic profile,
    allow the investigation of Holocene natural hazards and interactions between human
    activity and climatic changes at high-altitude. Annual sedimentation throughout
    the cores (glacial varves) is identified on photographs, ITRAX (high-resolution
    continuous microfluorescence-X) and CAT-Scan (computerized axial tomography) analyses
    and is supported by (1) the number of dark and light laminations between dates
    obtained by radionuclide measurements (137Cs, 241Am), (2) the correlation of a
    slump triggered by the nearby AD 1881 Allemond earthquake (MSK intensity VII)
    and of a turbidite triggered by the AD 1822 Chautagne regional earthquake (MSK
    intensity VIII), (3) the number of laminations between two accelerator mass spectrometry
    (AMS) 14C dates, and (4) archaeological data. In Lake Bramant, dark layers are
    coarser, contain less detrital elements, but more neoformed elements and organic
    matter content. These darker laminations result from calm background sedimentation,
    whereas the lighter layers are finer and rich in detrital elements and reflect
    the summer snowmelt. Traces of mining activity during the Roman civilization apogee
    (AD 115–330) and during the Early Bronze Age (3770–3870 cal BP) are recorded by
    lead and copper content in the sediments and probably result from regional and
    local mining activity in the NW Alps. Warmer climate during the Bronze Age in
    this part of the Alps is suggested by (1) two organic deposits (4160–3600 cal
    BP and 3300–2850 cal BP) likely reflecting a lower lake level and smaller glaciers
    and (2) evidence of a different vegetation cover around 2500 m a.s.l. The onset
    of clastic proglacial sedimentation between 3600–3300 cal BP and since 2850 cal
    BP is synchronous with periods of glacier advances documented in the Alps and
    high-lake levels in west-central Europe. This major change in proglacial sedimentation
    highlights the development of a larger St. Sorlin glacier in the catchment area
    of Lake Bramant.
