  abstract: There is growing concern about the environmental impact of rapid economic
    growth in China. The problem is compounded by the scarcity of baseline data on
    the state of China's natural environment. As a step towards solving this problem,
    palaeolimnological methods have been applied to seven lakes in the Jianghan Plain,
    China, to evaluate recent changes in human impact. Lake sediment cores show enhanced
    concentrations of fossil fuel derived spheroidal carbonaceous particles (SCP)
    and Pb at all sites across the Jianghan Plain. The distribution of these industrial
    contaminants shows the overwhelming influence of the industrial cities. Wuhan
    dominates the fossil fuel derived pollution, while the copper smelter at Daye
    dominates the heavy metal pollution. Analysis of sediment diatom assemblages indicates
    mean total phosphorus concentrations of greater than 40 Î¼g L-1 P in the lakes
    of the more intensely agricultural western part of the Jianghan Plain. The sediment
    concentration profiles for biogenic elements at these sites indicates a post-1960
    eutrophication. Evidence for eutrophication in the eastern lakes is much weaker,
    though some evidence is present at all sites. The tracers of industrial pollution
    (Pb and SCP) correlate with Mn in the many of the lake sediments. This is compatible
    with both soil acidification, and soil gleyification due to intensified rice production.
