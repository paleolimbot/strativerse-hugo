  abstract: 'Vertical distributions of As, Fe, and organic C were determined in dated
    (210Pb and 137Cs) sediment cores obtained from two adjacent basins (one perennially
    oxic and the other seasonally anoxic) of an oligotrophic headwater lake where
    atmospheric deposition is the only input of anthropogenic As. Despite similar
    sources in the two basins, the As profiles in the sediments differed markedly.
    Differences include the following: (i) As concentrations increased sharply upward
    close to the sediment surface in the perennially oxic basin due to scavenging
    of upward diffusing As by Fe oxyhydroxides, whereas they decreased in the seasonally
    anoxic basin where As scavenging by Fe oxyhydroxides did not occur, and (ii) the
    magnitude and position of major subsurface As maxima differed between the two
    basins. We applied a one-dimensional transport-reaction equation to porewater
    As concentration profiles obtained at the two sites to estimate sedimentary As
    concentrations at the time of deposition as well as subsequent addition or removal
    of As at various sediment depths. By multiplying As concentrations at the time
    of deposition by sediment mass accumulation rates, we were able to estimate variations
    in As fluxes at the sediment surface over the last two centuries. These fluxes
    were then transformed into atmospheric As deposition fluxes by applying a correction
    for basin-specific processes using the ratio of expected from atmospheric deposition
    to measured unsupported 210Pb inventories at the sampling sites. The resulting
    chronological profiles of atmospheric fluxes of As deposition are similar in both
    basins, and are consistent with both the history of specific markers for coal
    combustion and direct historical measurements of As in dry and wet atmospheric
    deposition in rural areas of North America. We conclude that the history of As
    inputs can be reconstructed from As sedimentary records using appropriate corrections
    for diagenesis and basin-specific processes.'
