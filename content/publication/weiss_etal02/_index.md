  abstract: The temporal evolution of atmospheric lead deposition and its possible
    sources were assessed in eastern Canada and in western Scotland, using blanket
    peat bogs as geochemical archives. Short cores were taken from two remote sites
    located close to the sea. Significant lead enrichments in the upper layers at
    both sites reflect the increasing emission of lead into the atmosphere due to
    anthropogenic activities during the last century. At the Scottish site, a region
    under aeolian influence from Europe, anthropogenic derived lead could be recognized
    by the distinctive unradiogenic composition (206Pby207Pb ratios down to ;1.115),
    being clearly different from the pre-industrial values (206Pby207Pb ;1.166). In
    contrast, the lead pollution in eastern Canada (influenced by North American sources)
    is identified by a more radiogenic lead isotope composition (206Pby207Pb ratios
    up to ;1.199) compared to pre- industrial values (206Pby207Pb ;1.161). Emission
    inventories and isotope characteristics suggest that industrial (coal burning,
    mining) and traffic (leaded gasoline) outputs are the most likely sources during
    the first and the second half of the 20th century, respectively, in both, western
    Scotland and eastern Canada alike. The Scottish record is in line with previous
    studies of past atmospheric lead deposition. However, the Canadian deposit suggests
    that the wind derived, pre-industrial lead, is less radiogenic as previously implied
    using sediment archives. These results are thus the first to report pre-industrial
    lead isotope ratios and concentrations of atmospheric derived aerosols in North
    America.
