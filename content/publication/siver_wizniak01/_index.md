  abstract: Lead analyses were performed on sediment cores from seven Connecticut
    lakes by dilute acid leaching. The absolute concentrations of lead varied from
    core to core, but the lead profiles were similar in all of the cores, and each
    depicted a point where the concentration of lead sharply increased above background
    levels. The background lead concentrations observed in the bottom portions of
    the cores ranged from 12-54 μg Pb/g sediment with a mean of 30 μg Pb/g, and increased
    to a mean maximum of 310 μg Pb/g. In six of the lakes significant increases above
    background levels were not noted until between 1924 and 1952, suggesting that,
    at least for Connecticut lakes, the point in a lake sediment core where the concentration
    of lead began to increase was after ca. 1924, and on average about 1930. Lead
    concentrations declined in the surface sediments of only three of the lakes, mostly
    since the 1980's, and presumably in response to the phasing out of leaded gasoline.
    However, significant declines in lead concentrations were not observed in the
    remaining cores, possibly due to increased motor vehicle use within the airshed
    of the lakes and/or changes in the export of lead to the lakes from their watersheds.
