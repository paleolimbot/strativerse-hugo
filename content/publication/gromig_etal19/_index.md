  abstract: 'Lake Ladoga in northwestern Russia is Europe''s largest lake. The postglacial
    history of the Ladoga basin is for the first time documented continuously with
    high temporal resolution in the upper 13.3 m of a sediment core (Co1309) from
    the northwestern part of the lake. We applied a multiproxy approach including
    radiographic imaging, (bio-)geochemical and granulometric analyses. Age control
    was established combining radiocarbon dating with varve chronology, the latter
    anchored to a correlated radiocarbon age from a lake close by. The age-depth model
    reveals the onset of glacial varve sedimentation at 13 910±140 cal. a BP, when
    Lake Ladoga was part of the Baltic Ice Lake. Linear extrapolation of published
    retreat rates of the Scandinavian Ice Sheet provides a formation age of the Luga
    moraine close to Lake Ladoga''s southern shore of 14.5?15.9 cal. ka BP, older
    than previously assumed. Varve sedimentation covers the B?lling/Aller?d interstadial,
    the Younger Dryas stadial and the Early Holocene. Varve-thickness variations,
    conjoined with grain-size and geochemical variations, inform about the relative
    position of the Scandinavian Ice Sheet and the climate during the deglaciation
    phase. The upper limit of the varved succession marks the change from glaciolacustrine
    to normal lacustrine sedimentation and post-dates the drainage of the Baltic Ice
    Lake as well as the formation of the Salpausselkä II moraine north of Lake Ladoga,
    by c. 250 years. The Holocene sediment record is divided into three periods in
    the following order: (i) a lower transition zone between the Holocene boundary
    and c. 9.5 cal. ka BP, characterized by mostly massive sediments with low organic
    content, (ii) a phase with increased organic content from c. 9.5 to 4.5 cal. ka
    BP corresponding to the Holocene Thermal Maximum, and (iii) a phase with relatively
    stable sedimentation in a lacustrine environment from c. 4.5 cal. ka BP until
    present.'
