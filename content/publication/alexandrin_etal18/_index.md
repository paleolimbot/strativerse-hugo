  abstract: 'Bottom sediments of the proglacial Lake Donguz-Orun situated at ~2500
    m a.s.l. in the Elbrus Region (Central Caucasus) reveal regular laminae, characteristic
    of proglacial varved lakes. This is the first laminated sediment sequence recorded
    in the region. However, visual counting of the layers was restricted due to partial
    indistinctness of the lamination. In order to confirm the annual sedimentary cyclicity
    and proceed with annually resolved data, in addition to the visual identification
    we used high resolution geochemical markers. The upper 160 mm of the sediment
    core were scanned at 200 µm intervals using synchrotron radiation X-ray fluorescence
    analysis (SR-XRF). Additional ultrahigh resolution scanning at 30 µm increments
    was employed for the upper 20 mm of the core. The Rb/Sr and Zr/Rb ratios are interpreted
    to record annual changes in grain-size. Based on this geochemical assessment,
    we identified 88 annual layers covering the interval between 1922 and 2010, while
    visually we have been able to identify between 70 and 100 layers. The correctness
    of the geochemical results is confirmed by mean accumulation rates assessed by
    137Cs and 210Pb dating. Cross-correlation between the ring width of local pine
    chronology and the layer thickness, identified as a distance between the annual
    Rb/Sr peaks, allowed for the accurate dating of the uppermost preserved year of
    the sediment sequence (AD 2010). Annually averaged elemental data were then compared
    with regional meteorological observations, glacier mass balance and tree-ring
    chronologies. The comparison revealed notable conformities: content of bromine
    is positively correlated with annual temperatures (r=0.41, p<0.01), content of
    terrigenous elements (major elements with the origin in watershed rocks) is positively
    correlated (up to r=0.44, p<0.01) with annual precipitation. A high statistically
    significant negative relationship is observed between the concentrations of terrigenous
    elements and tree-ring width of local pine chronology (up to r=-0.56, p<0.01).
    Taken together, these data point to a common composite climatic signal in the
    two independent records (lake sediments and tree rings) and confirm that the laminae
    represent annual layers (i.e., varves). These findings open opportunities for
    high resolution multiproxy climate reconstructions 300-350 years long using the
    longer sediment core and tree-ring records.'
