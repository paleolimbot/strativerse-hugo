  abstract: The geochemistry of lake sediments was used to identify anthropogenic
    factors influencing aquatic ecosystems of sub-alpine lakes in the western United
    States during the past century. Sediment cores were recovered from six high-elevation
    lakes in the central Great Basin of the United States. The proxies utilized to
    examine the degree of recent anthropogenic environmental change include spheroidal
    carbonaceous particle (SCP), mercury (Hg), and sediment organic content estimated
    using loss-on-ignition. Chronologies for the sediment cores, developed using 210Pb,
    indicate the cores span the twentieth century. Mercury flux varied between lakes
    but all exhibited increasing fluxes during the mid-twentieth century. The mean
    ratio of modern (post-A.D. 1985) to preindustrial (pre-A.D. 1880) Hg flux was
    5.2, which is comparable to the results from previous studies conducted in western
    North America. Peak SCP flux for all lakes occurred between approximately A.D.
    1940 and A.D. 1970, after which time the SCP flux was greatly reduced. The reduction
    in SCP input is likely due to better controls on combustion sources. Measured
    Hg concentrations and calculated sedimentation rates suggest atmospheric Hg flux
    increased in the early 1900s, from A.D. 1920 to A.D. 1990, and at present. Atmospheric
    deposition is the primary source of the anthropogenic inputs of Hg and SCPs to
    these high elevation lakes. The input of SCPs, which is largely driven by regional
    sources, has declined with the implementation of national pollution control regulations.
    Mercury deposition in the Great Basin has most likely been influenced more by
    regional inputs.
