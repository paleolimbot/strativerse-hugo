  abstract: Triplicate porewater depth-profiles of pH and concentrations of total
    Hg (HgT), methylmercury (MeHg), Fe, Mn, sulfate, total sulfide, total zero-valent
    sulfur, organic C and major ions were determined at two sampling dates in a perennially
    oxygenated basin and a seasonally anoxic basin from Lake Tantaré, a Canadian Shield
    lake. The vertical distribution of HgT, MeHg, acid volatile sulfide, total S,
    Fe, Mn, Al and organic C were also determined in dated sediment cores from the
    same lake basins and from the deepest site of two other lakes, one also located
    in the Canadian Shield and the other in the Northeastern part of the Appalachian
    Mountains. Application of a one-dimensional transport-reaction equation to the
    dissolved HgT and MeHg profiles constrains the depth intervals (zones) where these
    species are produced or consumed in the sedimentary column and yields estimates
    of net reaction rates of HgT or MeHg in each of the zones as well as their fluxes
    at the sediment–water interface. Dissolved HgT and MeHg diffused from the overlying
    water into the sediments, except for MeHg at one of the sampling dates in the
    perennially oxygenated basin. About 97% and 50% of the MeHg flux to the sediments
    is presently deposited with settling particles in the perennially oxygenated and
    seasonally anoxic basins, respectively. Removal of porewater HgT and MeHg occurred
    at all dates and sampling sites. Comparison of the consumption zones of porewater
    HgT and MeHg with the profiles of ancillary parameters, coupled with thermodynamic
    calculations, suggest that pure Hg mineral phases do not form in the sediments,
    that HgT and MeHg adsorption onto authigenic Fe oxyhydroxides occurs in minor
    proportions, and that the association of HgT and MeHg to Fe sulfide phases or
    sulfidized organic matter is possible. Assuming that the net consumption of MeHg
    in the porewaters was essentially due to demethylation, an apparent first-order
    rate constant for MeHg demethylation of 0.04–0.8d−1 was estimated. Production
    of porewater MeHg occurred only in the perennially oxygenated basin, at sediment
    depths where SO4 was consumed. Assuming that the net production of porewater MeHg
    was essentially due to methylation, an apparent first-order rate constant for
    Hg methylation ranging between 0.006d−1 and 0.1d−1 was calculated. These field-derived
    Hg methylation and MeHg demethylation rate constant values are within the range
    of those derived from Hg-spiked experiments. We also show that the post-depositional
    redistribution of total Hg during the early stages of sediment diagenesis is minor
    and that the solid-phase HgT record can be used to reconstruct the evolution of
    the anthropogenic HgT deposition.
