  abstract: Accurate metal deposition records in lake sediments are necessary to assess
    their present human health and ecological risk and to evaluate the effects of
    current or eventual measures to control metal emissions. Sediment cores and porewaters
    were collected in lakes located in uninhabited watersheds exposed to various levels
    of atmospheric metals. The interpretation of sedimentary metal profiles as historical
    records may be complex, however, as these profiles may be influenced by a variety
    of chemical, physical, and biological processes occurring naturally near the sediment-water
    interface. We used several independent approaches to distinguish the anthropogenic
    from the natural contributions in sediment metal profiles. A first approach compares
    metal profiles obtained in chemically similar lakes exposed to high and low metal
    loads from the atmosphere. A second approach uses geochemical and diagenetic modelling
    to evaluate the importance of metal diffusion as an internal remobilization process.
    Lastly, stable Pb isotopes are used to fingerprint possible sources of Pb to lake
    sediments and to evaluate their relative importance. Our preliminary results indicate
    that dated sediment profiles collected near large point sources essentially reflect
    chronological deposition trends. As shown for Cu, however, concentration profiles
    from remote sites can be slightly influenced by chemical changes occurring in
    surficial sediments.
