  abstract: 'For the first time, long-term monitoring (from 2002 to 2014) was carried
    out of surface sediments in Ludaš Lake, a Ramsar site in northern Serbia. Organic
    (16 EPA PAHs, mineral oils, selected pesticides and polychlorinated biphenyls
    (PCBs)) and inorganic substances (eight heavy metals: Ni, Zn, Cd, Cr, Cu, Pb,
    As and Hg) were continually investigated. Dibenzo[a,h]anthracene (DahA) and fluorene
    (Flo) were found at levels indicative of causing adverse effects to biota. Diagnostic
    ratios of specific PAHs were dominated by high molecular weight components, particularly
    DahA, which contributed 81.78 % of the total high carcinogens, benzo[b]fluoranthene
    (BbF) and Flo. Potential ecological risk factors (ERi) and the high relative standard
    deviations (RSD) obtained (up to 245 %) for the parameters monitored confirm the
    high periodical anthropogenic impact from industry, municipal wastewater and agriculture.
    The highest concentration of inorganic pollution found was for Cd (440–831 mg/kg)
    at all sites, Cu (439 mg/kg) in the eastern part of the lake and Cu (388 mg/kg)
    and Hg (771 mg/kg) in the northern part of the lake. Based on factor analysis
    of principal component analysis (PCA/FA), As and phenanthrene (Phe) had significant
    loadings (0.808 and 0.907, respectively). This association of As with organic
    anthropogenic sources was also confirmed with the sum of PAHs, pyrene (Pyr) and
    mineral oil by 3D factor plot, corroborating the theory of As mobilization from
    metal-reducing microbes as organic (methylated) forms, accelerated by phenanthrene.
    According to EU national and regional data results, this research suggests that
    Cu, As, dibenzo[a,h]anthracene and Flo should be added to the list of priority
    pollutants within the context of applying the European Water Framework Directive
    (WFD).'
