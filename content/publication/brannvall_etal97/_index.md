  abstract: We compare lead concentration and stable lead isotope analyses from three
    peat bog and three lake sediment records in Sweden. Radiocarbon dated stratigraphies
    give evidence that trends in the concentration of Pb in the peat and sediment
    cores are very similar, and follow the general outline of historical global Pb
    production over several thousand years. Due to the large difference in the 206Pb/207Pb
    ratio between Sweden, about 1.5, and continental Europe (excluding Fennoscandia),
    ≤1.2, it is possible to distinguish external sources of Pb to Sweden. In the lake
    sediments, profiles of 206Pb/207Pb ratio mirror the Pb concentration until 1000
    AD; increasing concentration is accompanied by decreasing ratios. After 1000 AD
    the ratio varies little at about 1.2 in sediments, because of the near total dominance
    of pollutant Pb. There is a further decline in the Pb ratio to about 1.14 in this
    century as a result of the addition of alkyl-Pb in petrol. The Pb concentration
    profiles in the peat match the lakes, but the isotope profiles do not. During
    the fen-to-bog transition there is a rapid decline in the 206Pb/207Pb ratio from
    >1.3 to about 1.2, and the ratio continues to decline to the present. We hypothesise
    that this is because externally-derived Pb from long-range transport of soil dust
    and atmospheric pollution has always been more important in the ombrotrophic peat
    than in lakes, which have a greater influx of catchment-derived Pb.
