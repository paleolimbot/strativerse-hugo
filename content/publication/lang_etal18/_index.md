  abstract: Reliable estimates of Holocene temperatures are important for understanding
    past climate dynamics, the response of biota to climate change, and validating
    climate models. Chironomids in lake sediment cores are used widely to quantify
    past summer temperatures, for which high-latitude and/or high-altitude lakes,
    remote from human influence, are usually considered appropriate. Temperature inferences
    from lowland lakes are likely influenced by other variables, specifically eutrophication
    and industrial pollution, but their reliability has never been tested. We used
    a Norwegian chironomid-based transfer function (r 2 = 0.91; RMSEP = 1.01 Â°C) to
    infer mean July air temperature over the last 200 years, using chironomid assemblages
    in a core collected from a polluted, nutrient-enriched lake at Speke Hall, Liverpool,
    England. The chironomid-inferred temperatures correlate significantly with the
    local instrumental temperature record and follow long-term national temperature
    trends. These results show that chironomids can be used to produce reliable estimates
    of past mean July air temperature, even when other variables have also influenced
    the composition of the chironomid community. These findings underline the value
    of chironomids as sensitive and reliable quantitative proxies for summer temperature.
