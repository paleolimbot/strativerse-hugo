  abstract: Two short sediment cores were recovered from sub-basins of Lake Qinghai,
    China and were analyzed for concentrations of Pb and 16 other elements to determine
    historic, regional atmospheric Pb deposition on the Tibetan Plateau. Core chronologies,
    dating back to the eighteenth century, were established using activities of 210Pb
    and 137Cs. The 17 elements were divided into three principal components. Variations
    in concentrations of PC1 elements (Al, Cr, Cu, Fe, K, Mn, Ni, and Ti) demonstrate
    different patterns between the two cores, and are attributed to different sediment
    sources in the two sub-basins. PC2 elements (Ba, Ca, Na, and Sr) may be associated
    with the degree of catchment weathering and/or water chemistry. Four elements
    (Pb, Zn, P, and Co) are related to both PC1 and PC2, and reflect a mixture of
    natural and anthropogenic sources. The PC3 element is Mg in the north sub-basin,
    and is perhaps related to aragonite precipitation and/or increased farming. Elevated
    Pb concentrations in uppermost sediments of both cores signify a recent regional/global
    increase in anthropogenic Pb release into the environment. After subtracting lithogenic
    Pb, derived from rock weathering and/or dust and normalized to the background
    immobile element Ti, results suggest that excess, anthropogenic Pb is transferred
    to the lake and its sediments predominantly via the atmosphere. This anthropogenic
    atmospheric Pb is comparable in magnitude and displays similar variation patterns
    in the two cores, reflecting regional atmospheric deposition and local erosion.
    The average anthropogenic Pb deposition rate in Lake Qinghai since the 1960s has
    been ~12.2 Â± 3.5 mg/m2/a, comparable with atmospheric Pb fluxes reported for sites
    elsewhere in the northern hemisphere.
