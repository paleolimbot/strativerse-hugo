  abstract: Loch Lomond in Scotland was part of the sea not only in late Devensian
    times but also in the middle Flandrian. Deep water cores from the southern basin
    show sediment with marine plankton and low remanent magnetism (RMN) between freshwater
    sediments. Raised beaches, deltas and estuarine flats were formed during the Flandrian
    transgression which 14C dating shows to have to lasted some 1,450 yr from 6,900
    to 5,450 yr BP. Palaeomagnetic matching enables an intercomparison of Windermere
    and Lomond 14C timescales and implies that both may be in error.
