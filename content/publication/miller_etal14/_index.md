  abstract: A high-resolution record of pollution is preserved in recent sediments
    from Windermere, the largest lake in the English Lake District. Data derived from
    X-ray core scanning (validated against wavelength dispersive X-ray fluorescence),
    radiochronological techniques (210Pb and 137Cs) and ultrahigh precision, double-spike
    mass spectrometry for lead isotopes are combined to decipher the anthropogenic
    inputs to the lake. The sediment record suggests that while most element concentrations
    have been stable, there has been a significant increase in lead, zinc, and copper
    concentrations since the 1930s. Lead isotope down-core variations identify three
    major contributory sources of anthropogenic (industrial) lead, comprising gasoline
    lead, coal combustion lead (most likely source is coal-fired steam ships), and
    lead derived from Carboniferous Pbâ€“Zn mineralization (mining activities). Periods
    of metal workings do not correlate with peaks in heavy metals due to the trapping
    efficiency of up-system lakes in the catchment. Heavy metal increases could be
    due to flood-induced metal inwash after the cessation of mining and the weathering
    of bedrock in the catchment. The combination of sediment analysis techniques used
    provides new insights into the pollutant depositional history of Windermere and
    could be similarly applied to other lake systems to determine the timing and scale
    of anthropogenic inputs.
