  abstract: Atmospheric pollution, one of the leading environmental problems in South
    and East Asia, and its impact on the terrestrial environmental quality remain
    poorly understood particularly in alpine areas where both historical and present-day
    mining and smelting operations might leave an imprint. Here, we reconstructed
    atmospheric trace metals pollution during the past century using core sediments
    from a large and deep alpine lake in Southwest China. The implication of in lake
    and/or in watershed sediment focusing in pollution quantification is discussed
    by analyzing 15 sediment cores. Factor analysis and enrichment factor indicated
    Cd, Pb and Sb as the typical pollutants. Distinct peaks of Pb and Sb pollution
    were observed around the 1920s, but little Pb pollution was detected in recent
    decades, different from other studies in similar regions. Cadmium pollution was
    observed until the mid-1980s synchronized with Sb. The distinctive variations
    in atmospheric trace metal pollution process in Southwest China highlight the
    regional and sub-regional sources of metal pollutants, which should be primarily
    attributed to non-ferrous metal smelting emissions. Both natural and anthropogenic
    metals showed wide concentration ranges though exhibited similar temporal trends
    in the 15 cores. Spatial variations of anthropogenic metals were influenced by
    the in-watershed pollutants remobilization, whereas, natural metals were regulated
    by the detrital materials in the sub-basin. In-lake sediment focusing had little
    influence on the spatial distributions of all metals, different from the traditional
    sediment focusing pattern observed in small lakes. Anthropogenic Cd accumulation
    in sediments ranged from 1.5 to 10.1mgm−2 in a specific core with an average of
    6.5mgm−2 for the entire lake, highlighting that a reliable whole-lake pollutant
    budget requires an analysis of multiple cores. Our study suggests that the management
    of aquatic ecosystem health should take the remobilization of in-watershed stored
    pollutants into consideration especially under increasing human perturbation.
