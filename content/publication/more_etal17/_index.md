  abstract: Contrary to widespread assumptions, next-generation high (annual to multiannual)
    and ultra-high (subannual) resolution analyses of an Alpine glacier reveal that
    true historical minimum natural levels of lead in the atmosphere occurred only
    once in the last ~2000 years. During the Black Death pandemic, demographic and
    economic collapse interrupted metal production and atmospheric lead dropped to
    undetectable levels. This finding challenges current government and industry understanding
    of preindustrial lead pollution and its potential implications for human health
    of children and adults worldwide. Available technology and geographic location
    have limited previous ice core investigations. We provide new high- (discrete,
    inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry, ICP-MS) and ultra-high resolution
    (laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry, LA-ICP-MS) records
    of atmospheric lead deposition extracted from the high Alpine glacier Colle Gnifetti,
    in the Swiss-Italian Alps. We show that contrary to the conventional wisdom, low
    levels at or approaching natural background occurred only in a single 4 year period
    in ~2000 years documented in the new ice core, during the Black Death (~1349–1353
    C.E.), the most devastating pandemic in Eurasian history. Ultra-high chronological
    resolution allows for the first time detailed and decisive comparison of the new
    glaciochemical data with historical records. Historical evidence shows that mining
    activity ceased upwind of the core site from ~1349 to 1353, while concurrently
    on the glacier lead (Pb) concentrations—dated by layer counting confirmed by radiocarbon
    dating—dropped to levels below detection, an order of magnitude beneath figures
    deemed low in earlier studies. Previous assumptions about preindustrial “natural”
    background lead levels in the atmosphere—and potential impacts on humans—have
    been misleading, with significant implications for current environmental, industrial,
    and public health policy, as well as for the history of human lead exposure. Trans-disciplinary
    application of this new technology opens the door to new approaches to the study
    of the anthropogenic impact on past and present human health.
