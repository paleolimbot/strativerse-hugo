  abstract: Anthropogenically derived pollutants (e.g. trace metals, organochlorines,
    radionuclides) are deposited upon arctic ecosystems. To determine the range of
    probable biotic effects of these pollutants, one must know the rate at which they
    enter and are retained within an ecosystem. However, unknown deposition mechanisms
    and the complexity of quantifying atmospheric concentrations of constituents of
    interest make direct measurements of pollutant flux to arctic terrestrial and
    aquatic ecosystems difficult and/or impractical. Methods of indirectly measuring
    rates of pollutant accumulation, such as lake sediment stratigraphic analyses,
    can fill this void. Present in the sediment of two Alaskan lakes sampled in April
    1991 were quantifiable concentrations of numerous organochlorine compounds, including
    DDT and its metabolites (Sum, 0.05-0.60 ng/g), PCBs (Sum, 0.20–30 ng/g), and lindane
    (0.20-0.80 ng/g). These surface concentrations correspond to estimated deposition
    rates of 2–6 ng/m2/year ( ∑DDT + metabolites), 10–300 ng/m2/year ( ∑PCBs), and
    8–10 ng/m2/year (lindane). The rates and chronologies of accumulation of these
    pollutants and others are discussed with regard to the process of long-range atmospheric
    transport.
