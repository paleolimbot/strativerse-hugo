  abstract: Mercury (Hg) concentration profiles and historical accumulation rates
    were determined in three 210Pb-dated cores from a peat deposit in the vicinity
    of a lead (Pb) smelter at Příbram, Czech Republic. The Hg concentrations in peat
    samples ranged from 66 to 701μgkg−1. Cumulative Hg inventories from each core
    (for the past ∼150yr) varied by a factor of 1.4 (13.6–18.5mgHgm−2), indicating
    variations of net Hg accumulation rate within the peat deposit. Historical changes
    in vegetation cover (leading to variable interception by trees) are probably responsible
    for this variation in space and time. The uncorrected Hg accumulation rates peaked
    between the 1960s and 1980s (up to 226μgm−2yr−1). Recent findings show that Hg
    records from peat tend to overestimate historical levels of Hg deposition. Therefore
    we used the mass loss compensation factor (MLCF) to normalize Hg accumulation
    rates. These corrected Hg accumulation rates were significantly lower (maximum
    129μgm−2yr−1) and better corresponded to changes in historical smelter emissions,
    which were highest in the 1960s. The agreement between the corrected Hg accumulation
    rates in the uppermost peat sections (2–38μgm−2yr−1) and biomonitoring of atmospheric
    deposition by mosses in several recent years (4.7–34.4μgm−2yr−1) shows the usefulness
    of MLCF application on Hg accumulation in peat archives. However, the MLCF correction
    was unsuitable for Pb. The recent Pb deposition rates obtained by an independent
    biomonitoring study using mosses (0.5–127mgm−2yr−1) were better correlated with
    net Pb accumulation rates recorded in peat (7–145mgm−2yr−1) than with corrected
    rates obtained by the MLCF approach (1–28mgm−2yr−1).
