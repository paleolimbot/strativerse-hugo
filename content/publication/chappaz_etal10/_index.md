  abstract: Uranium geochemistry has been investigated in three acid lakes located
    on the Canadian Shield and one circumneutral lake in the Appalachian Region of
    Eastern Canada. In all Shield lakes, dissolved U concentrations were higher in
    the porewater than in the overlying water. In one of them, whose hypolimnion is
    perennially oxic, U released to porewater at depths of Fe remobilization was removed
    from the porewater at depths of Fe oxyhydroxides precipitation; these similarities
    in the U and Fe profiles indicate that part of the U becomes associated to Fe
    oxyhydroxides. The dissolved U and Fe profiles in the other two Shield lakes,
    whose hypolimnions were anoxic when sampled, did not show any significant recycling
    of these elements in the vicinity of the sediment–water interface and both elements
    diffused from the sediment to the overlying water. In contrast, in the Appalachian
    Lake, dissolved U concentrations were higher in the overlying water than in porewater,
    strongly decreased at the vicinity of the sediment–water interface and then remained
    relatively constant with sediment depth. Diagenetic modeling of the porewater
    U profiles, assuming steady-state, reveals that authigenic U always represented
    ⩽3% of the total U concentration in the sediments of all lakes. This observation
    indicates that diagenetic reactions involving U are not quantitatively important
    and that most of the U was delivered to the sediments at our study sites as particulate
    U and not through diffusion across the sediment–water interface, as is seen in
    continental margin sediments. Comparison of the U:Corg and U:Fe molar ratios in
    diagenetic material collected across the sediment–water interface with Teflon
    sheets and in surface sediments (0–0.5cm) of the lake having a perennially oxic
    hypolimnion suggest that solid phase U was mainly bound to organic matter originating
    from the watershed; a strong statistical correlation between sediment non-lithogenic
    U and Corg in the Appalachian Lake supports this contention. Thermodynamic calculations
    of saturation states suggest that dissolved U was not removed from porewater through
    precipitation of UO2(s), U3O7(s) and U3O8(s) as previously proposed in the literature.
