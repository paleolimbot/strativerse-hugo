  abstract: Kejimkujik National Park, in Nova Scotia, Canada, is a sensitive region
    for metal(loid) contamination, such as mercury, in part due to long-range atmospheric
    deposition from global and regional industrial centers. The region is remote from
    industrial centres, but is downwind of major pollution sources in the Eastern
    United States and Canada, and historically had numerous gold mining sites. Due
    to a paucity of long-term atmospheric deposition monitoring in this region, little
    is known about the response of Kejimkujik lakes to multiple changing global, regional
    and local atmospheric Hg and metal(loid) sources. Here we used multiple lake sediment
    cores to reconstruct anthropogenic depositional fluxes of metal(loid)s of concern
    for the last ~210 years. Results showed that Kejimkujik lake sediments are highly
    enriched in lead (Pb), antimony (Sb) and tin (Sn), with post-industrial metal(loid)
    concentrations being >4-fold greater than natural baseline levels (prior to ~1800)
    and moderately enriched in silver (Ag), bismuth (Bi), cadmium (Cd), copper (Cu),
    mercury (Hg), rubidium (Rb), tellurium (Te), thallium (Tl), vanadium (V), tungsten
    (W) and zinc (Zn), with post-industrial metal(loid) concentrations being between
    1.5 and 4-fold greater than natural baseline levels (prior to ~1800). Lake sediment
    core reconstructions of total atmospheric Hg deposition matched well with Hg wet
    deposition monitoring data from the overlapped period (1997–2010) being 9.1 ± 2.7 μg/m2/yr
    and 7.0 ± 0.7 μg/m2/yr respectively. Lakes closest to historic gold mining sites
    show spikes in Ag, Cd, Sb, Tl, Zn and W during mining periods (~1880 and 1950).
    Most of the enriched metal(loid)s (EF >1.5) (Ag, Bi, Cu, Hg, Pb, Sb, Sn, V and
    W) do not appear affected by redox and remobilisation issues. For the other enriched
    metal(loid)s (EF >1.5) (Cd, Tl, and Zn), remobilisation from upper sediments appears
    to be occurring within these acidic and DOC rich Kejimkujik lakes.
