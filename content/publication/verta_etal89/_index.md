  abstract: 'Profiles of heavy metals and major metals were determined in sediment
    cores from 18 small, headwater drainage and seepage lakes in Finland. More than
    half of the lakes have recently been acidified. The results show an increase of
    Pb deposition starting in the early 1800s. Most of the Pb profiles show a levelling
    off or slight decrease in the deposition rate in the post-1980 sediments. The
    first signs of increases of Zn, Cd and Hg typically appear during the 1800s; a
    prominent increase in the sedimentation of these elements is typically confined
    to this century. Clear subsurface (2–5 cm) concentration maxima of Zn and Cd were
    observed in cores from many lakes in south Finland. The maxima are not related
    to changes in emission and atmospheric deposition. Subtraction of the background
    fluxes from the total fluxes of the 1980s gives the following percentages for
    atmospheric deposition: Pb, 74–97% of the total; Cd, 62–92%; Zn, 39–91%; and Hg,
    70–89%. These figures apply to southern and central Finland, areas that also have
    the highest deposition of acidic compounds. In northern Finland the increase in
    deposition starts later and has remained smaller than in the south. About half
    of the profiles of Cu and V and a third of the Ni profiles showed increased accumulation,
    typically after 1950. Recent increases in the concentration and accumulation rates
    of Na, K and Mg, observed in most cores in southernmost Finland, may also be of
    atmospheric origin. This is suggested by the chemistry of bulk deposition.'
