  abstract: The transition elements Mn, Fe, Co, Zn, Cu and Cr together with Pb and
    P were determined in three sequential extractions of sediment and in the pore
    water of a 35-cm sediment core from Lake Geneva. A high percentage of the mobile
    Mn, Fe, P, Co, Pb and Zn was extracted in the first (inorganic) fraction, whereas
    the mobile Cu and Cr were mostly found in the second (organic and sulfide) fraction.
    Mn was subject to recycling with solubilization from the surface sediment to the
    oxic bottom water where it was precipitated. Highly enriched Co and P values were
    observed in the top few mm of the sediment resulting from post depositional solubilization
    with upward migration and precipitation with oxi-hydroxides at the sediment surface.
    The slower increase of Cu, Zn and Pb concentrations towards the sediment/water
    interface are the result of an increase of anthropogenic sources over the past
    decades. A further increase in Pb in the first cm of the core is believed to be
    related to the freshly precipitated Mn oxi-hydroxides.
