  abstract: 'To study the long-range transport of atmospheric pollutants from lower
    latitude industrial areas to the Arctic, we analysed a peat core spanning the
    last ~700cal.yr (~1300–2000CE) from southern Greenland, an area sensitive to atmospheric
    pollution from North American and Eurasian sources. A previous investigation conducted
    in the same location recorded atmospheric lead (Pb) pollution after ~1845, with
    peak values recorded in the 1970s, and concluded that a North American source
    was most likely. To confirm the origin of the lead, we present new Pb isotope
    data from Sandhavn, together with a high-resolution record for mercury (Hg) deposition.
    Results demonstrate that the mercury accumulation rate has steadily increased
    since the beginning of the 19th century, with maximum values of 9.3μgm−2yr−1 recorded
    ~1940. Lead isotopic ratios show two mixing lines: one which represents inputs
    from local and regional geogenic sources, and another that comprises regional
    geogenic and pollution sources. Detrending the Pb isotopic ratio record (thereby
    extracting the effect of the geogenic mixing) has enabled us to reconstruct a
    detailed chronology of metal pollution. The first sustained decrease in Pb isotope
    signals is recorded as beginning ~1740–1780 with the lowest values (indicating
    the highest pollution signature) dated to ~1960–1970. The 206Pb/207Pb ratio of
    excess Pb (measuring 1.222, and reflecting pollution-generated Pb), when compared
    with the Pb isotopic composition of the Sandhavn peat record since the 19th century
    and the timing of Pb enrichments, clearly points to the dominance of pollution
    sources from North America, although it did not prove possible to further differentiate
    the emissions sources geographically.'
