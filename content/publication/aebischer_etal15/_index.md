  abstract: Iron mining in Schefferville (1939–1977) in subarctic Quebec has left
    behind large numbers and quantities of tailing deposits. The impact of past mining
    activity on aquatic ecosystems in the Schefferville area has been studied using
    geochemical and isotopic (Pb, Zn and Fe) analyses of lake sediments, ore deposits,
    tailings and epiphytic lichens. Analysis of two sediment cores from Lakes Dauriat
    and Oksana reveals that the surface geochemical cycle of the Schefferville area
    has been profoundly disturbed by anthropogenic activity such as mining. Disturbances
    were particularly abrupt at the transitions from pre-mining to mining and mining
    to post-mining periods. Elemental and isotopic analyses of the lake sediments
    reveal four different end-member contributions to the lake sedimentation, with
    changes in terms of sources and source contribution observed throughout the sedimentation
    history. End-members were identified using Pb, Zn and Fe isotopes and are consistent
    for each element. Lead isotope ratios vary from highly radiogenic (206Pb/204Pb=27)
    to less radiogenic (206Pb/204Pb=17.7) from the bottom to the top of the sediment
    cores. Iron isotope compositions vary from −0.2‰ to 1‰, the latter value remaining
    constant throughout the sedimentary history of Lake Oksana. A systematic difference
    in the Zn isotope ratios of the two lakes is also observed, and can be explained
    by local differences in basin lithology. In order to identify pollution sources,
    samples from ores and tailings and epiphytic lichens were measured as proxies
    of mining activity, lithology, and atmospheric deposition, respectively. The impact
    of anthropogenic activity is clearly evident in the sediment records and results
    from mining activity, as well as local urban and industrial activities (waste
    water inputs). Long-range atmospheric deposition also accounts for some of the
    variations in isotopic composition measured in the sediments. The systematic coupling
    of Pb isotopes with Zn or Fe isotopes allows us to identify and constrain the
    metal sources that contributed to sediment contamination. This study demonstrates
    that disturbance due to mining activities is very effective in rapidly modifying
    lake sediment composition. Though the disturbances remained local in terms of
    geographic extent, the damage to the aquatic ecosystem has been significant and
    may persist for decades.
