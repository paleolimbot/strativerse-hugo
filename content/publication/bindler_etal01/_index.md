  abstract: Lead (Pb), like many other pollutants, is carried into the Arctic by long-range
    atmospheric transport from industrial centers at lower latitudes. Unlike other
    pollutants, Pb can be used to assess emission source regions through the use of
    stable Pb isotope analyses. Using sediment cores from 17 lakes (three profiles
    and 14 top/bottom sample pairs) in the Søndre Strømfjord (Kangerlussuaq) region,
    West Greenland (67°N), this study assesses the extent and origin of Pb pollution
    along a 150km transect between the Inland Ice and Davis Strait. Like ice core
    analyses from the interior of Greenland, the isotope analyses suggest pre-industrial
    contamination, although significant concentration changes in the lake sediments
    do not occur until the 18th/19th centuries, with the maximum concentrations occurring
    about 1970. Compared to the background, the Pb concentrations in recent sediments
    have increased about 2.5-fold, with slightly higher enrichments towards the coast,
    where annual precipitation is highest. For all of the lakes, there is a major
    decline in the 206Pb/207Pb ratio in the recent sediments (mean 1.218±0.030) as
    compared to deeper sediments (mean 1.365±0.084). Using a Pb isotope mixing model,
    we calculated an excess Pb isotope ratio, i.e. the isotope ratio necessary to
    produce the observed declines in recent sediments. While studies of atmospheric
    aerosols in the high Arctic (206Pb/207Pb ratio ∼1.16) have indicated that Russian
    emissions (206Pb/207Pb ratio ∼1.15–1.16) are a dominant source of arctic pollution,
    the excess Pb ratios of the lake sediments in the Søndre Strømfjord region (206Pb/207Pb
    ratio ∼1.14–1.15), in the low Arctic, suggest that W Europe (206Pb/207Pb ratio
    ∼1.14) is also a major emission source for this region.
