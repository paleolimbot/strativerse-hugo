  abstract: Anthropogenically elevated Hg deposition in arctic and subarctic ecosystems
    is potentially a serious environmental problem, particularly in northern Europe
    and North America. To determine the magnitude of this concern, it is necessary
    to make an evaluation over a broad spatial scale. In the absence of an established
    network of atmospheric monitoring stations for Hg deposition, we have utilized
    sediment flux ratios derived from lake sediment profiles throughout the arctic
    and subarctic to evaluate spatial and temporal patterns of Hg flux to watersheds.
    Total Hg mass accumulations in layers of 210Pb dated sediment cores collected
    from Finland, Sweden, Canada, U.S.A. and Russia were analyzed to construct flux
    ratios. Flux ratios are calculated by dividing the average recent (i.e. last ∼
    10–40 yr) or industrial era Hg flux by an average pre-industrial Hg flux value.
    Results differ widely across the arctic regions of the northern hemisphere. The
    highest flux ratios were found in regions associated with strong regional sources
    of atmospheric Hg emissions such as central and eastern North America and Central
    Europe. Lakes throughout the U.S. Arctic and the Taimyr Peninsula of Russia showed
    only slight (∼30%) enrichment over background fluxes. Large differences existed
    in background Hg flux depending on the nature of the watershed geology with some
    lakes in Alaska exhibiting relatively high concentrations of sediment Hg without
    evidence of anthropogenic enrichment. In North America, there is a tendency for
    Hg flux ratios to increase in an southeasterly direction toward the highest concentration
    of continental emission sources (coal fired power plants, Chlor-alkali plants,
    metal smelters and waste incinerators). In northern Europe (Sweden and Finland)
    there is a trend of increasing Hg flux ratios in the north to south direction.
    Our results suggest that anthropogenic Hg deposition is the dominant regional
    mercury deposition process in some northern regions but of lesser importance in
    landscapes highly remote from urban/industrial Hg emissions.
