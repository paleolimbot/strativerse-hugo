  abstract: Korosi JB, Thienpont JR, Eickmeyer DC, Kimpe LE, Blais JM. 2020. A paleolimnological
    approach for interpreting aquatic effects monitoring at the Diavik Diamond Mine
    (Lac de Gras, Northwest Territories, Canada). Lake Reserv Manage. XX:XXâ€“XX. A
    paleolimnological assessment of Lac de Gras (Northwest Territories, Canada) showed
    pronounced aquatic ecological and biogeochemical changes occurring since at least
    circa 1950, well before diamond mining operations began in 2000. These changes
    are likely a response to regional climate warming, which is confounding the interpretation
    of an Aquatic Effects Monitoring Program (AEMP) intended to identify early-warning
    indicators of diamond-mining impacts to water quality. In the latest AEMP report,
    action level exceedances based on 3 years of monitoring in Lac de Gras were reported
    for chlorophyll a and strontium, yet sediment cores collected from 3 different
    sites in the lake exhibited notable increasing trends in these parameters since
    pre-1950. Increases in the small, centric diatom Discostella pseudostelligera
    have also been occurring since pre-1950, which we infer to be a response to climate
    warming. Recent (post-1996) D. pseudostelligera increases observed from aquatic
    effects monitoring of nearby small lakes have previously been linked to nitrogen
    fertilization from diamond mining. Thus, our paleolimnological results clearly
    indicate that parameters predicted to respond to mining impacts are also responding
    similarly to regional climate warming. Based on this, AEMP adaptive management
    strategies need to consider the potential additive or synergistic effects of mining
    and climate change when establishing action level exceedances for water quality
    and ecological indicators. Using our paleolimnological data, we calculated background
    (premining) rates of change in key geochemical parameters that can provide a benchmark
    for evaluating ongoing changes in the current mining period, and for establishing
    AEMP significance thresholds.
