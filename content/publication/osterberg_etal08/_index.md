  abstract: A high-resolution, 8000 year-long ice core record from the Mt. Logan summit
    plateau (5300 m asl) reveals the initiation of trans-Pacific lead (Pb) pollution
    by ca. 1730, and a >10-fold increase in Pb concentration (1981–1998 mean = 68.9
    ng/l) above natural background (5.6 ng/l) attributed to rising anthropogenic Pb
    emissions from Asia. The largest rise in North Pacific Pb pollution from 1970–1998
    (end of record) is contemporaneous with a decrease in Eurasian and North American
    Pb pollution as documented in ice core records from Greenland, Devon Island, and
    the European Alps. The distinct Pb pollution history in the North Pacific is interpreted
    to result from the later industrialization and less stringent abatement measures
    in Asia compared to North America and Eurasia. The Mt. Logan record shows evidence
    for both a rising Pb emissions signal from Asia and a trans-Pacific transport
    efficiency signal related to the strength of the Aleutian Low.
