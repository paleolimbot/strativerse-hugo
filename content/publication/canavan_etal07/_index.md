  abstract: Concentrations of Fe, Mn, Cd, Co, Ni, Pb, and Zn were determined in pore
    water and sediment of a coastal fresh water lake (Haringvliet Lake, The Netherlands).
    Elevated sediment trace metal concentrations reflect anthropogenic inputs from
    the Rhine and Meuse Rivers. Pore water and sediment analyses, together with thermodynamic
    calculations, indicate a shift in trace metal speciation from oxide-bound to sulfide-bound
    over the upper 20 cm of the sediment. Concentrations of reducible Fe and Mn decline
    with increasing depth, but do not reach zero values at 20 cm depth. The reducible
    phases are relatively more important for the binding of Co, Ni, and Zn than for
    Pb and Cd. Pore waters exhibit supersaturation with respect to Zn, Pb, Co, and
    Cd monosulfides, while significant fractions of Ni and Co are bound to pyrite.
    A multi-component, diagenetic model developed for organic matter degradation was
    expanded to include Zn and Ni dynamics. Pore water transport of trace metals is
    primarily diffusive, with a lesser contribution of bioirrigation. Reactions affecting
    trace metal mobility near the sediment–water interface, especially sulfide oxidation
    and sorption to newly formed oxides, strongly influence the modeled estimates
    of the diffusive effluxes to the overlying water. Model results imply less efficient
    sediment retention of Ni than Zn. Sensitivity analyses show that increased bioturbation
    and sulfate availability, which are expected upon restoration of estuarine conditions
    in the lake, should increase the sulfide bound fractions of Zn and Ni in the sediments.
