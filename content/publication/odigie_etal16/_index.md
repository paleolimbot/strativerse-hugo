  abstract: Temporal changes in the amounts of trace elements (As, Co, Cu, Mn, Ni,
    Pb, and Zn) and their correlations with temporal changes in charcoal abundance
    in age-dated sediments collected from Lake Thompson in Patagonia, Chile, attest
    to the substantial pyrogenic remobilization of contaminants that occurred in Patagonia
    during the mid-1900s. This remobilization was concurrent with the extensive slash
    and burn period in the region during that period. The changes in concentrations
    of Co, Cu, and Ni in relation to charcoal abundance in the lacustrine sediments
    over time were small compared to those of As, Mn, Pb, and Zn. However, the relatively
    low enrichment factors of all those trace elements, normalized to Fe, indicate
    that they were predominantly derived from local, natural sources impacted by fires
    rather than industrial sources. The primarily local source of Pb in the sediments
    was corroborated by the temporal consistency of its isotopic ratios (206Pb/207Pb:208Pb/206Pb),
    which were similar to previously reported values for natural lead in Central and
    Southern Chile. However, the pyrogenic remobilization of both natural and industrial
    trace elements by forest fires in Chile and elsewhere is expected to rise as a
    consequence of climate change, which is projected to increase both the frequency
    and intensity of forest fires on a global scale.
