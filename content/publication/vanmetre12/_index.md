  abstract: Atmospheric deposition of Hg is the predominant pathway for Hg to reach
    sensitive ecosystems, but the importance of emissions on near-field deposition
    remains unclear. To better understand spatial variability in Hg deposition, mercury
    concentrations were analyzed in sediment cores from 12 lakes with undeveloped
    watersheds near to (<50 km) and remote from (>150 km) several major urban areas
    in the United States. Background and focusing corrected Hg fluxes and flux ratios
    (modern to background) in the near-urban lakes (68 ± 6.9 μg m−2 yr−1 and 9.8 ± 4.8,
    respectively) greatly exceed those in the remote lakes (14 ± 9.3 μg m−2 yr−1 and
    3.5 ± 1.0) and the fluxes are strongly related to distance from the nearest major
    urban area (r2 = 0.87) and to population and Hg emissions within 50–100 km of
    the lakes. Comparison to monitored wet deposition suggests that dry deposition
    is a major contributor of Hg to lakes near major urban areas.
