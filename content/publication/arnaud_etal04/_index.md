  abstract: 'Lead concentrations and isotopic ratios were measured along two well-dated
    sediment cores from two distant lakes: Anterne (2100 m a.s.l.) and Le Bourget
    (270 m a.s.l.), submitted to low and high direct human impact and covering the
    last 250 and 600 years, respectively. The measurement of lead in old sediment
    samples (>3000 BP) permits, in using mixing-models, the determination of lead
    concentration, flux and isotopic composition of purely anthropogenic origin. We
    thus show that since ca. 1800 AD the regional increase in lead contamination was
    mostly driven by coal consumption (206Pb/207Pb ∼ 1.17–1.19; 206Pb/204Pb ∼ 18.3–18.6),
    which peaks around 1915 AD. The increasing usage of leaded gasoline, introduced
    in the 1920s, was recorded in both lakes by increasing Pb concentrations and decreasing
    Pb isotope ratios. A peak around 1970 (206Pb/207Pb ∼ 1.13–1.16; 206Pb/204Pb ∼
    17.6–18.0) corresponds to the worldwide recorded leaded gasoline maximum of consumption.
    The 1973 oil crisis is characterised by a drastic drop of lead fluxes in both
    lakes (from ∼35 to <20 mg cm−2 yr−1). In the late 1980s, environmental policies
    made the Lake Anterne flux drop to pre-1900 values (<10 mg cm−2 yr−1) while Lake
    Le Bourget is always submitted to an important flux (∼25 mg cm−2 yr−1). The good
    match of our distant records, together and with a previously established series
    in an ice core from Mont Blanc, provides confidence in the use of sediments as
    archives of lead contamination. The integration of the Mont Blanc ice core results
    from Rosman et al. with our data highlights, from 1990 onward, a decoupling in
    lead sources between the high elevation sites (Lake Anterne and Mont Blanc ice
    core), submitted to a mixture of long-distance and regional contamination and
    the low elevation site (Lake Le Bourget), where regional contamination is predominant.'
