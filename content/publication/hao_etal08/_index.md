  abstract: The rapid economic development in the Yangtze River Delta (YRD), China
    in the last three decades has had a significant impact on the environment of the
    East China Sea (ECS). Lead isotopic compositions of a 210Pb dated sediment core
    collected from the coastal ECS adjacent to the Yangtze River Estuary were analyzed
    to track the Pb pollution in the region. The baseline Pb concentration in the
    coastal ECS sediments before the industrialization in China was 32μgg−1, and the
    corresponding 206Pb/207Pb ratio was 1.195. The high-resolution profiles of Pb
    flux and 206Pb/207Pb ratios had close relationships with the economic development
    and the history of the use of leaded gasoline in China, and they were clearly
    different from those of most European countries and United States.
