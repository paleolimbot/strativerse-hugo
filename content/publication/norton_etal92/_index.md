  abstract: Sediment cores from 30 low-alkalinity lakes in northern New England (NE),
    New York (NY), the northern Great Lakes States (NGLS) of Minnesota, Michigan,
    and Wisconsin, and Florida (FL) have been dated by 210Pb and analyzed for water
    and organic content, eight major elements (Al, Ti, Fe, Mn, Ca, Mg, Na, K) plus
    four trace metals (Pb, Zn, Cu, and V). Variations in the percentages of major
    elements through time are dominated by long-term independent variations in the
    abundance of SiO2, FeO, and to a lesser extent Ca and Al. Additional variations
    are caused by varying proportions of inorganic matter. Major variations in chemistry
    are generally unrelated to documented distrubances in the watersheds; most disturbances
    are minor fires or selective logging.Accelerated accumulation of Pb from atmospheric
    sources into sediment first occurs in sediment dated between 1800 and 1850 in
    NY and NE, slightly later in the NGLS region, and about 1900 in FL. Modern accumulation
    rates in all areas are comparable (ca. 1 to 4 μg cm−2 yr−1). Accumulation rates
    of Pb in some lakes have declined significantly from 1975 to 1985. Atmospheric
    deposition of anthropogenic Zn and Cu is also indicated by generally increasing
    accumulation rates in sediment cores, but the record is not as clear nor are chemical
    profiles in all lakes parallel to the trends in atmospheric emissions inferred
    on the basis of fossil fuel consumption, smelting, and other industrial activities.
    Inter-lake variations in profiles of Cu and Zn are large. Vanadium accumulation
    rates increase by the 1940s in NY and NE, but not until the 1950s in the NGLS
    region. This timing correlates with regional trends in the combustion of fuel
    oil, a major source of atmospheric V.Acidification of some of the lakes is suggested
    by decreases in the concentration and accumulation rates of Mn, Ca, and Zn in
    recent sediment, relative to other elements of catchment origin. The decreases
    generally occur slightly before the onset of acidification as indicated by diatoms.
    Increased sediment accumulation rates for Fe may indicate the acidification of
    watershed soils. The use of the accumulation rate of TiO2 as an indicator of rates
    of erosion and for normalization of trace metal accumulation rates is in question
    for lakes where the flux of TiO2 from the atmosphere varies and is a significant
    fraction of the total flux of TiO2 to the sediment.
