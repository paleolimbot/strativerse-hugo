  abstract: Atmospheric lead (Pb) pollution during the last century in central Yunnan
    province, one of the largest non-ferrous metal production centers in China, was
    reconstructed using sediment cores collected from Fuxian and Qingshui Lakes. Lead
    concentrations and isotopic ratios (207Pb/206Pb and 208Pb/206Pb) were measured
    in sediment cores from both lakes. The operationally defined chemical fractions
    of Pb in sediment core from Fuxian Lake were determined by the optimized BCR procedure.
    The chronology of the cores was reconstructed using 210Pb and 137Cs dating methods.
    Similar three-phase variations in isotopic ratios and enrichment factors of Pb
    were observed in the sediment cores from both lakes. Before the 1950s, the sediment
    data showed low 207Pb/206Pb and 208Pb/206Pb ratios and enrichment factors (EFs
    = ~1), indicating that the sedimentary Pb was predominantly of lithogenic origin.
    However, these indices were increased gradually between the 1950s and the mid-1980s,
    implying an atmospheric Pb deposition. The EFs and isotopic ratios of Pb reached
    their peak during recent years, indicating aggravating atmospheric Pb pollution.
    The average anthropogenic Pb fluxes since the mid-1980s were estimated to be 0.032
    and 0.053 g m−2 year−1 recorded in Fuxian and Qingshui cores, respectively. The
    anthropogenic Pb was primarily concentrated in the reducible fraction. Combining
    the results of Pb isotopic compositions and chemical speciations in the sediment
    cores and in potential sources, we deduced that recent aggravating atmospheric
    Pb pollution in central Yunnan province should primarily be attributed to regional
    emissions from non-ferrous metal production industries.
