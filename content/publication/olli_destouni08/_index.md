  abstract: Long-term sediment pollution by lead (Pb), copper (Cu) and zinc (Zn) is
    investigated in Karlskärsviken, a typical bay of Lake Mälaren, about 10 km northwest
    of Stockholm. We find that metal accumulation rates in the sediments of Karlskärsviken
    increase considerably more in the outer than in the inner bay section, all the
    time since medieval times and even more so after than before industrialisation.
    Resulting metal accumulation rates are dominated by increasing sediment accumulation
    rate and its spatial–temporal patterns. This indicates significant waterborne
    metal pollution contributions to the bay sediments, which continue until present
    times and are still increasing for Zn and Cu. The outer Karlskärsviken bay section
    is then mainly affected by regional waterborne discharges, while the inner bay
    section is mainly affected by local discharges, in addition to the atmospheric
    deposition that affects the whole bay and Lake Mälaren similarly. The present
    results indicate possible important shortcomings in environmental regulation,
    management and monitoring systems that consider only sediment concentration levels
    and neglect pollutant accumulation rates and diffuse metal load contributions
    from slow subsurface transport into surface water environments.
