  abstract: 'The U.S. Geological Survey Reconstructed Trends National Synthesis study
    collected sediment cores from 56 lakes and reservoirs between 1992 and 2001 across
    the United States. Most of the sampling was conducted as part of the National
    Water-Quality Assessment (NAWQA) Program. The primary objective of the study was
    to determine trends in particle-associated contaminants in response to urbanization;
    47 of the 56 lakes are in or near one of 20 U.S. cities. Sampling was done with
    gravity, piston, and box corers from boats and push cores from boats or by wading,
    depending on the depth of water and thickness of sediment being sampled. Chemical
    analyses included major and trace elements, organochlorine pesticides, polychlorinated
    biphenyls, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, cesium-137, and lead-210. Age-dating
    of the cores was done on the basis of radionuclide analyses and the position of
    the pre-reservoir land surface in the reservoir and, in a few cases, other chemical
    or lithologic depth-date markers. Dates were assigned in many cores on the basis
    of assumed constant mass accumulation between known depth-date markers. Dates
    assigned were supported using a variety of other date markers including first
    occurrence and peak concentrations of DDT and polychlorinated biphenyls and peak
    concentration of lead. A qualitative rating was assigned to each core on the basis
    of professional judgment to indicate the reliability of age assignments. A total
    of 122 cores were collected from the 56 lakes and age dates were assigned to 113
    of them, representing 54 of the 56 lakes. Seventy-four of the 122 cores (61 percent)
    received a good rating for the assigned age dates, 28 cores (23 percent) a fair
    rating, and 11 cores (9 percent) a poor rating; nine cores (7 percent) had no
    dates assigned. An analysis of the influence of environmental factors on the apparent
    quality of age-dating of the cores concluded that the most important factor was
    the mass accumulation rate (MAR) of sediment: the greater the MAR, the better
    the temporal discretization in the samples and the less important the effects
    of postdepositional sediment disturbance. These age-dated sediment cores provide
    the basis for local-, regional-, and national-scale interpretations of water-quality
    trends.'
