  abstract: Vertical Pb concentration gradients and isotope ratios (206Pb/207Pb, 208Pb/207Pb)
    are reported for five 210Pb-dated Sphagnum peat profiles. The studied peat bogs
    are in the British Isles (Thorne Moors, England; Mull, Scotland; and Connemara,
    Eire) and central Europe (Ocean, northern Czech Republic; Rybarenska slat, southern
    Czech Republic). Both the U.K. and the Czech Republic experienced maximum Pb emissions
    from Ag–Pb smelting around 1880. Pb emissions from coal burning peaked in 1955
    in the U.K. and in the 1980s in the Czech Republic. In both countries, use of
    alkyl-lead additives to gasoline resulted in large Pb emissions between 1950 and
    2000. We hypothesized that peaks in Pb emissions from smelting, coal burning and
    gasoline burning, respectively, should be mirrored in the peat profiles. However,
    a more complicated pattern emerged. Maximum annual Pb accumulation rates occurred
    in 1870 at Ocean, 1940 at Thorne Moors, 1988 at Rybarenska slat, and 1990 at Mull
    and Connemara. Atmospheric Pb inputs decreased in the order Thorne Moors≥Ocean>Rybarenska
    slat>Mull>Connemara. The Ocean bog was unique in the central European region in
    that its maximum Pb pollution dated back to the 19th century and coincided with
    maximum Pb smelting at Freiberg and Pribram. In contrast, numerous previously
    studied sites showed no Pb accumulation maximum in the 19th century, but increasing
    pollution until the 1980s. It remains unclear why Ocean did not record the regional
    peak in Pb emissions caused by high coal and gasoline burning around 1980, while
    an array of nearby bogs studied previously did record the 1980 coal/gasoline peak,
    but no 1880 smelting peak. Mean 206Pb/207Pb ratios of potential pollution sources
    were 1.07 and 1.11 for gasoline, 1.17 and 1.17 for local ores, and 1.18 and 1.19
    for coal in the U.K. and the Czech Republic, respectively. The calculated percentages
    of gasoline-derived Pb in peat (≤55% for the British Isles and ≤63% for the Czech
    Republic) were surprisingly low. An explanation for the low percentage of gasoline-derived
    Pb in peat can be more easily found for the Czech sites (until 1989 Czechoslovakia
    was the third largest lignite producer in the world). Regional differences in
    deposition rates of gasoline-derived Pb in the U.K. need further study.
