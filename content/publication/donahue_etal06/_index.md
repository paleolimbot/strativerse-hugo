  abstract: Trace metals and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) were analyzed
    in sediment cores from three central Alberta lakes to determine the contributions
    of local coal-fired power plants to contaminant loadings. In Wabamun Lake, with
    four power plants built since 1950 within a 35-km radius, sediment concentrations
    of mercury, copper, lead, arsenic and selenium have increased by 1.2- to 4-fold.
    Trace metal enrichments were less pronounced in Lac Ste. Anne and Pigeon Lake,
    situated 20 km north and 70 km south of Wabamun Lake, respectively. Total Hg flux
    to Wabamun Lake sediments (21–32μg m−2 yr−1) has increased 6-fold since 1950,
    compared to 2- and 1.5-fold increases in Lac Ste. Anne and Pigeon Lake, respectively,
    since circa 1900. Total PAH flux to surface sediments was 730–1100μg m−2 yr−1
    in Wabamun Lake, 290–420μg m−2 yr−1 in Lac Ste. Anne, and 140–240μg m−2 yr−1 in
    Pigeon Lake. Without adoption of pollution-abatement technology that compensates
    for increases in generating capacity, continued expansion of coal-burning industry
    in Alberta will result in increased contaminant deposition, primarily from local
    sources.
