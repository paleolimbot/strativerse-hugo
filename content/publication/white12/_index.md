  abstract: The Isthmus of Chignecto on the New Brunswick - Nova Scotia border is
    the location of the Tantramar, Missaguash, and Amherst Marshes, which together
    form a large coastal wetland system that has been the focus of much ecosystem
    research and habitat modification even though little is known about the systemsâ€™
    evolution. In this study, lithostratigraphic and chemostratigraphic lake sediment
    records from three lakes are used to provide a high resolution record of post-glacial
    environmental change for the region. Basal dates for the study lakes range from
    >10,000 cal. yr BP to < 4000 cal. yr BP, indicating that each lake provides a
    unique story on landscape and salt marsh evolution. Lake sediment stratigraphy
    indicates rapid fluctuations in lake productivity. Chemostratigraphic proxies
    indicate fluctuating salinity and oxygen levels in two of the three lakes and
    show that multiple saltwater incursions likely occurred. Analyses of metals indicate
    anomalously high pre-historic concentrations of Pb and Hg (8 ppm and 870 ppb respectively).
    Historic concentrations of Pb and Hg provide evidence for significant atmospheric
    deposition from industrialization and anthropogenic sources. Collectively, these
    data suggest that a sophisticated model is required to adequately explain the
    physical evolution of this extensive wetland system. Periods of sustained saltwater
    influx into freshwater systems were likely a fundamental driver of systems change.
    Additionally, both anthropogenic and natural disturbances of the lakes and wetlands
    have the potential to increase the bioavailability of contaminants. Management
    of these wetlands must take into account the sensitivity of the wetland system
    to environmental disturbance.
