  abstract: The Arctic is recognized as an important focus for long-range transport
    of contaminants, such as mercury (Hg), from industrial regions at lower latitudes.
    In addition to large geographic gaps, there are few long-term retrospective time
    trends in arctic research, besides the Greenland ice record, to assess the onset
    of atmospheric pollution as well as to establish the rates of change in the terrestrial
    environment. In a study of sediments from 21 lakes along a 150 km transect from
    the coast to the ice sheet margin in the Søndre Strømfjord (Kangerlussuaq) region,
    we present stratigraphic evidence for elevated Hg inputs to this ice-free region
    on Greenland's west coast. Nineteen study lakes showed Hg concentration enrichments
    (HgEFconc) in surface compared to deeper sediments, with a mean HgEFconc of 3.
    Higher HgEFconc are found in lakes closest to the ice margin. The existence of
    this Hg gradient is supported by pollution Hg inventories in three 210Pb-dated
    cores. While 210Pb inventories and Pb pollution are higher at the coast, pollution
    Hg inventories are nearly 3-fold higher at the ice margin (570 μg m-2) than at
    the coast (210 μg m-2). These dated cores also indicate an onset of Hg pollution
    in the region beginning at least by the late 19th century but possibly as early
    as the 17th century.
