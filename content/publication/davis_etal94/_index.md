  abstract: Studies of sediment cores from 12 acidic lakes in granitic, forested and
    uninhabited catchments in northern New England, U.S.A. produced diatom-inferred
    pH (IpH) 5.2 to 5.8 and alkalinity (Ialk) −12 to 31 µeq l−1, with slowly declining
    values at some lakes, for one to four centuries prior to logging. Increases of
    IpH (Δ0.05 to 0.60) and Ialk (Δ5 to 40 µeq l−1) correlate with logging in the
    catchments in the early-1800s to early-1900s. Recovery to pre-logging IpH and
    Ialk correlates with forest succession toward conifers, and is completed in the
    late-1800s to mid-1900s. Beginning at 1915–1920 (4 lakes), 1930–1950 (4 lakes)
    and 1965–1970 (4 lakes), IpH and Ialk start decreasing below pre-logging values
    due to atmospheric acidic deposition, leading to respective total decreases of
    0.10 to 0.45 (X=0.25) and 5 to 25 µeq l−1 (X=15). Inputs of anthropogenic Pb,
    Zn, V, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, and soot from the atmosphere are first
    detectable in early- to late-1800s sediment, and Cu in late-1800s sediment, increase
    rapidly in the late-1800s to mid-1900s, and level off or decrease since the 1960s
    — partly due to emission controls. Decreasing Ca, Mn, and possibly Zn relative
    to other metals and normalized to organic content, and increasing flux of Fe to
    the lakes, indicate soil and water acidification after 1900.
