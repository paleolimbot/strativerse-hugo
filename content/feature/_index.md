Features are geographic entities (like a lake, bog, or glacier) from which [records](/record) contain an archive of environmental change. Most of the features in the strativerse are are lakes, because [Dewey Dunnington](https://fishandwhistle.net/) is a trace metals in lake sediments guy. Most features have boundaries that were found from looking at the [Open Street Map](https://openstreetmap.org/).
