  abstract: IN the past few decades, there has been considerable debate about whether
    vegetational and soil changes associated with changing land-use can cause surface-water
    acidification in lakes1,2. Although it is now widely accepted that the severe
    and extensive acidification that has occurred recently in southern Scandinavia,
    northern Britain and North America3,4 has been chiefly caused by atmospheric acid
    deposition, the role of changing land-use for moderate acidification is still
    not fully understood5,6. Here we report analyses of sediment records from Swedish
    lakes, which provide evidence that land-use changes can have an important influence
    on the pH of acid-sensitive lakes. Following the expansion of an agrarian economy
    during the Iron Age (from about 2,500 years ago), pH increased from about 5.5
    to about 6.5. Our results suggest that this pH increase was caused by burning,
    agriculture, forest grazing and other culture-related practices that increased
    the base saturation and pH of the soils, and enhanced the transport of base cations
    and nutrients from the soils to the surface waters, thus indicating these lakes
    may be naturally more acidic than had been thought. Following this period of alkalization,
    pH in many lakes fell to about 4.5 during the present century. Although cessation
    of former land-use practices could account for some of this change, the unprecedentedly
    low pH in recent years must be due predominantly to acid deposition.
