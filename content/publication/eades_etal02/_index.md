  abstract: Sediment cores from three Scottish freshwater lakes, Loch Ness in the
    remote north and Loch Lomond and the Lake of Menteith, much closer to the heavily
    populated and industrialised central belt, were analysed for 210Pb, 137Cs, Pb
    and stable Pb isotopic composition (206Pb/207Pb). The radionuclide data were used
    to establish chronologies for the Loch Ness and Loch Lomond cores, but a chronology
    could not be developed for the Lake of Menteith core, in which the surface sediment
    had been subject to intense mixing. Although Pb concentrations generally started
    increasing during the mid-17th Century, a small peak occurred for Loch Ness in
    the early 16th Century, perhaps attributable to the influence of medieval mining
    and smelting in mainland Europe. Temporal trends in the pattern of Pb accumulation
    were similar for Loch Ness and both sites in Loch Lomond, with 40–50% of the anthropogenic
    Pb deposited prior to the 20th Century. Fluxes of anthropogenic Pb to the lake
    sediments peaked during the 1950s at all locations where chronologies could be
    established. The 5-fold increase in anthropogenic Pb inventory for the southern
    basin of Loch Lomond relative to Loch Ness reflected geographical proximity to
    the main polluting sources. The 206Pb/207Pb data for anthropogenic Pb in the sediments
    from Loch Ness and Loch Lomond exhibited largely similar trends related to five
    different time periods. Pre-1820, the 206Pb/207Pb ratio was close to that for
    coal (1.181). From 1820 to 1900, a fairly constant 206Pb/207Pb ratio of ∼1.17
    probably resulted from a combination of emissions from the smelting of indigenous
    Pb ore (1.170) and coal burning (1.181) in Scotland, and industrial activity to
    the south in England, where Australian Pb of characteristically low 206Pb/207Pb
    ratio (1.04) was already in use. From 1901 to 1930, the 206Pb/207Pb ratio declined
    by <0.01, due to the increasing influence of Australian Pb. From 1931 to 1975/1985,
    the 206Pb/207Pb ratio of anthropogenic Pb declined by a further 0.03 to 0.04,
    to minimum values from approximately 1975 to 1985, primarily a consequence of
    car-exhaust emissions of Pb arising from the introduction of alkyl Pb petrol additives
    (206Pb/207Pb ∼1.06–1.09). From 1975/1985 to the mid-1990s, the 206Pb/207Pb ratio
    of anthropogenic Pb increased by up to 0.015, a consequence of a reduction in
    car-exhaust emissions of Pb, resulting from reductions in the maximum permitted
    concentration of Pb in petrol, and the introduction and increasing uptake of unleaded
    petrol. Source apportionment calculations, on the basis of 206Pb/207Pb values
    in surface sediment, suggested that the contribution of Pb emissions from the
    use of leaded petrol was 27–40% of the atmospheric burden by the mid-1990s, in
    line with estimates from rainwater 206Pb/207Pb data.
