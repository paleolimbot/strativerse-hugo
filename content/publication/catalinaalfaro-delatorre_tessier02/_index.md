  abstract: A dated core from the profoundal zone in a pristine oligotrophic acidic
    lake was analyzed for Cd as well as for Al, Ca, Fe, Mg, Mn, Pb, Ti and total carbon
    and nitrogen. Overlying water and porewater samples were also obtained on six
    occasions at the same site, and yielded vertical profiles of pH and dissolved
    Cd, Ca, Fe, Mg, Mn, sulfide, SO4−2, organic and inorganic carbon concentrations.
    These extensive porewater and sediment geochemical data were used, together with
    information on infaunal benthos, to decipher the sedimentary record of Cd contamination.
    Depth variation of sediment Ca concentrations indicate that the lake suffered
    from progressive acidification starting about 1950. The present-day accumulation
    rate of Cd (JaccCd = 5.4 ± 0.4 × 10−11 mol cm−2 yr−1) in the sediments is the
    sum of the flux of Cd deposited with settling particles (JSCd = 3.3 ± 0.2 × 10−11
    mol cm−2 yr−1) and the fluxes of dissolved Cd across the sediment-water interface
    due to molecular diffusion (JDCd = 1.8 ± 0.3 × 10−11 mol cm−2 yr−1), bioturbation
    (JBCd = 1.1 ± 0.2 × 10−14 mol cm−2 yr−1) and bioirrigation (JICd = 0.27 ± 0.05
    × 10−11 mol cm−2 yr−1). Biological mixing of the sediments was negligible. The
    shape of the vertical profile of total Cd concentration with depth in the sediment
    appears to be determined more by its input history than by post-depositional mobilization
    and redistribution in the sediment column.
