  abstract: Pb isotopes and Pb concentrations were measured in two sediment cores
    sampled in Lake Geneva (i) at the center of the basin (central plain) and (ii)
    in an area which receives the effluents of the wastewater treatment plant of Lausanne
    as well as runoff inputs. The presence of an anthropogenic contribution is observed
    over all the sampled period (∼150 years), even at the center of the lake. At both
    sites, the maximum contamination of Pb occurred in the late 1970s, and has declined
    to present. The site close to Lausanne received much more Pb than the one at the
    center of the lake. Surprisingly, the Pb isotopes show that gasoline-derived Pb
    has had a minor influence, at least over the last 20 years. Instead, deposition
    of Pb from industrial (and domestic) activities predominates. This study demonstrates
    that one of the major limitations of the isotopic method is the poor (or partial)
    knowledge of how the isotopic compositions of potential sources have evolved through
    the past. A simple method of sample dissolution, based on HNO3 leaching assisted
    by microwave, is also presented. We believe that this sample preparation can be
    extensively used because it provides a reliable estimate of Pb having an anthropogenic
    origin.
