  abstract: Water-quality trends were assessed in Lake Houston using age-dated sediment
    cores. Sediments deposited in the lake contain a partial chemical signature of
    human activities in the watershed. Over time, a water-quality history is recorded
    in the bottom sediments. Although the sediments in Lake Houston are clean compared
    to sediment-quality guidelines, increasing concentrations of mercury, zinc, and
    polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) during the past several decades are evidence
    of the increasing human effect on water quality. The positive effects of regulation
    are indicated by decreases in concentrations of lead and DDT.
