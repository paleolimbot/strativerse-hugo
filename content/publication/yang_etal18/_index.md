  abstract: There has been a considerable reduction in anthropogenic lead (Pb) emission
    in the atmosphere in recent decades. However, the reduction in Pb inputs in many
    lakes does not match this as the Pb stored in catchment upper soil layers, derived
    from previous deposition, has become an important source although it is difficult
    to assess quantitatively. This work uses atmospherically deposited 210Pb as a
    tracer to track Pb movement, and so for the first time, we were able to calculate
    the relative Pb inputs from direct atmospheric deposition and catchment sources
    to lakes in the U.K. directly. Within individual lake sites, ratios of 210Pb/Pb
    in the catchment terrestrial mosses were normally an order of magnitude higher
    than those in the catchment surface soils, trapped lake sediments, and the surface
    sediments in the lake bottom. Results suggest that the Pb isotope signatures in
    the mosses are close to or dominated by atmospheric depositions, and it is reasonable
    to use the ratios of 210Pb/Pb in terrestrial mosses collected from the lake sites
    with a high annual rainfall over 2000 mm to represent those in atmospheric depositions.
    It reveals that after the reduction in Pb emissions, catchment Pb inputs now typically
    account for more than 95% of the total Pb entering the lakes.
