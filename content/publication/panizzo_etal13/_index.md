  abstract: 'Lake Xiaolongwan is a closed maar lake located in the Long Gang Volcanic
    Field, northeast China. Core XLW2 was collected in 2007 from the central region
    of the lake and provides a palaeoecological reconstruction over the past ca. 130
    years (dated using radiometric methods: 210Pb and 137Cs). Diatom floristic changes
    and catchment productivity (carbon isotope ratios) were analysed within the core.
    Indicators of atmospheric pollution (XRF and SCP inventories) were also measured.
    Results show a marked transition from a dominant benthic assemblage to a planktonic
    one (increasing P:B ratios) starting after ca. 1940 AD, becoming most prominent
    after ca. 1980 AD (P:B > 1). Most notable floristic changes result from the increase
    in the planktonic species Discostella woltereckii. These changes are concomitant
    with increased temperature trends from the region and reconstructed temperature
    anomalies of the Northern Hemisphere. SCP concentrations and flux rates also increase
    after ca. 1950 AD, with highest values seen at ca. 1980 AD after which values
    decline. Normalised elemental geochemistry (e.g. Pb/Ti) also show marked changes
    after ca. 1970 AD, most likely derived from atmospheric deposition of Pb. The
    recent increase in D. woltereckii precedes anthropogenic contamination (Pb/Ti)
    at the site and persists after the decline in SCP concentrations. This suggests
    that the recent increases are driven by increased mean annual temperature trends.
    These temperature trends may be manifested as changes in ice cover persistence,
    a longer growing season and/or increased DOC at Lake Xiaolongwan: conditions for
    which planktonic species have a more competitive advantage.'
