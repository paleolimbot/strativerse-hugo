  abstract: This paper describes the use of 210Pb and 137Cs radioactivity measurements
    to determine the rates of sedimentation in the Great Lakes. Cores from eight locations
    in Lake Michigan were chosen for examination to cover as wide as possible a range
    of sedimentation rates and representative sedimentary environments. The surficial
    210Pb activity in the sediments varies between 7 and 23 pCi/g dry wt and its profile
    in each core shows the expected exponential decrease with depth consistent with
    the assumption of uniform sedimentation rate over the last hundred years and secular
    equilibrium between supported 210Pb and 226Ra (0.5-1.0 pCi/g dry wt). Companion
    measurements of 137Cs indicate that the coring technique satisfactorily recovered
    the uppermost levels of the deposit and that the mobility of both radionuclides
    within the sediment is probably small. Based on the limited number of cores analyzed
    to date, it appears that modern sedimentation rates are not very different from
    average rates for the last 7000 yr. The excess 210Pb appears to originate primarily
    from atmospheric fallout, but a further inventory of the 210Pb distribution over
    the lake bottom must be made to properly assess the significance of other sources.
    The spatial distributions of both 137Cs and 210Pb at certain stations suggest
    that the mode of transport of these radionuclides are comparable and involve attachment
    to settling particles. A mathematical model is developed which accounts for the
    observed limited mobility of both 210Pb and 137Cs in several of the cores in terms
    of post-depositional redistribution by physical or biological mixing processes.
