  abstract: Paleoecological analyses of sediments from nine northern Great Lakes states
    (NGLS) lakes reveal small pH changes in seven of these lakes since 1860, four
    of these being declines. The largest diatom-inferred (DI) pH declines of 0.5 pH
    units were found in Brown L. and Denton L., Wisconsin. Two other lakes with suspected
    total alkalinity declines (based on an acidification model and on historical water
    chemistry, respectively), McNearney L., Michigan, and Camp 12 L., Wisconsin, have
    not acidified recently according to diatom-inference techniques. Many of the observed
    trends of increasing pH are coincident with logging; floristic composition of
    diatom assemblages also changed coincident with fisheries manipulations in some
    lakes, but these floristic trends did not affect DI pH. Sediment core profiles
    of Pb, S, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons provide a record of atmospheric
    deposition of fossil fuel combustion products beginning around the turn of the
    century; onset is later and accumulation rates are smaller than for other northeastern
    study regions of the Paleoecological Investigation of Recent Lake Acidification
    (PIRLA) Project. The response of diatom species to lakewater pH in the NGLS region
    is very strong and similar to response in other regions. Overall, there is little
    paleoecological evidence that acidic deposition has caused significant acidification
    of lakes in the NGLS region.
