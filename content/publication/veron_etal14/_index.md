  abstract: We have measured pollen, aluminum, and lead abundances in a Czech peat
    bog at Bozi Dar in order to investigate the environmental impact of Holocene climate
    changes and mining activities in Central Europe. The pollen record shows a continuous
    vegetal cover since 13 kyr BP. Aluminum and pollen deposition characterize the
    Younger Dryas (YD) cold event at 12.3–11.0 kyr BP, within its expected time frame
    in Northern Europe. Aluminum fluxes reveal four other significant dust events
    with significant Asian and Saharan sources, as shown with variations in stable
    204Pb, 206Pb, and 207Pb isotopes. Recurrent Asian incursions are seen at Bozi
    Dar during the YD and Mid-Holocene dust events (at 7.1, 6.5, and 5.9 kyr BP).
    These Asian imprints are also observed by Le Roux and colleagues during the YD
    in the nearest Holocene-long geochemical peat record from Switzerland (Etang de
    la Gruère). We do not see at Bozi Dar the distinct western European volcanic inputs
    identified in the Swiss peat by Shotyk and colleagues. However, isotopic ratios
    characteristics of Mediterranean airflows are evident at both locations during
    the Mid- and Late Holocene. The occurrence of these various air mass sources in
    Switzerland and the Czech Republic substantiates Holocene atmospheric circulation
    models in Central Europe with dominating zonal airflows during the Early Holocene,
    followed by a governing meridian dispersion during the Mid- and Late Holocene.
    Lead inputs at 5.1–4.3 and 1.9 kyr BP cannot be explained by increased dust deposition
    only. The 1.9 kyr event fits local Bohemian ore isotopic imprints of which isotopic
    signatures are seen as early as 2.2 kyr BP in our core, hence revealing the oldest
    ever environmental record of mining-related activities in the Czech Republic.
    Relatively elevated Pb deposition at 5.1 and 4.3 kyr BP are tentatively attributed
    to contamination that may be from local sources and/or long-range transport.
