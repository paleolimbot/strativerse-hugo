  abstract: Lead isotopic compositions and Pb and Ba concentrations have been measured
    in ice cores from Law Dome, East Antarctica, covering the past 6500 years. ‘Natural’
    background concentrations of Pb (∼0.4 pg/g) and Ba (∼1.3 pg/g) are observed until
    1884 AD, after which increased Pb concentrations and lowered 206Pb/207Pb ratios
    indicate the influence of anthropogenic Pb. The isotopic composition of ‘natural’
    Pb varies within the range 206Pb/207Pb=1.20–1.25 and 208Pb/207Pb=2.46–2.50, with
    an average rock and soil dust Pb contribution of 8–12%. A major pollution event
    is observed at Law Dome between 1884 and 1908 AD, elevating the Pb concentration
    four-fold and changing 206Pb/207Pb ratios in the ice to ∼1.12. Based on Pb isotopic
    systematics and Pb emission statistics, this is attributed to Pb mined at Broken
    Hill and smelted at Broken Hill and Port Pirie, Australia. Anthropogenic Pb inputs
    are at their greatest from ∼1900 to ∼1910 and from ∼1960 to ∼1980. During the
    20th century, Ba concentrations are consistently higher than ‘natural’ levels
    and are attributed to increased dust production, suggesting the influence of climate
    change and/or changes in land coverage with vegetation.
