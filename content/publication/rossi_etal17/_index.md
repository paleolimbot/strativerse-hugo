  abstract: Early industrial trace metal loadings are poorly characterized but potentially
    substantial sources of trace metals to the landscape. The magnitude of legacy
    contamination in southwestern Pennsylvania, the cradle of North American fossil
    fuel industrialization, is reconstructed from trace metal concentrations in a
    sediment core with proxies including major and trace metal chemistry, bulk density,
    and magnetic susceptibility. Trace metal chemistry in this sediment record reflects
    19th and 20th century land use and industry. In particular, early 19th century
    arsenic loadings to the lake are elevated from pesticides used by early European
    settlers at a lakeside tannery. Later, sediment barium concentrations rise, likely
    reflecting the onset of acidic mine drainage from coal operations. Twentieth century
    zinc, cadmium, and lead concentrations are dominated by emissions from the nearby,
    infamous Donora Zinc Works yet record both the opening of a nearby coal-fired
    power plant and amendments to the Clean Air Act. The impact of early industry
    is substantial and rivals more recent metal fluxes, resulting in a significant
    potential source of contaminated sediments. Thus, modern assessments of trace
    metal contamination cannot ignore early industrial inputs, as the potential remobilization
    of legacy contamination would impact ecosystem and human health.
