  abstract: A quantitative historical record of anthropogenic lead deposition has
    been determined for the Haliburton region of southern Ontario from a) the relative
    change in lead concentration in undisturbed sediment cores, and b) the total anthropogenic
    lead deposition measured in the region. The first parameter was measured on two
    sediment cores from a meromictic lake. Total lead deposition was assumed to be
    the average of that measured for eight other lakes in the study area. The validity
    of this historical record was tested on sediment cores from nearby dimictic lakes.
    Predicted lead concentration profiles closely resembled observed profiles.
