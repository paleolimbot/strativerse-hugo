  abstract: Peat cores were collected from five bogs in the vicinity of open pit mines
    and upgraders of the Athabasca Bituminous Sands, the largest reservoir of bitumen
    in the world. Frozen cores were sectioned into 1 cm slices, and trace metals determined
    in the ultraclean SWAMP lab using ICP-QMS. The uppermost sections of the cores
    were age-dated with 210Pb using ultralow background gamma spectrometry, and selected
    plant macrofossils dated using 14C. At each site, trace metal concentrations as
    well as enrichment factors (calculated relative to the corresponding element/Th
    ratio of the Upper Continental Crust) reveal maximum values 10 to 40 cm below
    the surface which shows that the zenith of atmospheric contamination occurred
    in the past. The age-depth relationships show that atmospheric contamination by
    trace metals (Ag, Cd, Sb, Tl, but also V, Ni, and Mo which are enriched in bitumen)
    has been declining in northern Alberta for decades. In fact, the greatest contemporary
    enrichments of Ag, Cd, Sb, and Tl (in the top layers of the peat cores) are found
    at the control site (Utikuma) which is 264 km SW, suggesting that long-range atmospheric
    transport from other sources must be duly considered in any source assessment.
