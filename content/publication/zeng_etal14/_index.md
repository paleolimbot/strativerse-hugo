  abstract: A short sediment core from Lake Sayram, China, was used to develop a high-resolution
    record of heavy metal inputs from the Tianshan Mountains and the surrounding region
    over the last 200 years. We investigated metal inputs to Lake Sayram using the
    geo-accumulation index (Igeos) and enrichment factors (EFs). Anthropogenic metal
    fluxes were calculated to quantify the human contribution to heavy metal pollution.
    Lake Sayram has been polluted by Cd, As, Pb, and Hg since the 1960s, and has had
    three distinct periods in its pollution history. Prior to 1960, metals in Lake
    Sayram sediments were mainly from natural sources, with very low values of EFs
    and Igeos. From the 1960s to 1990s, heavy metal delivery to sediments increased
    slowly, associated with relatively weak economic development in Xinjiang Province,
    similar to other areas of China. Thereafter, contamination by heavy metals increased
    markedly, especially after the 2000s. Lake Sayram was considered to be moderately
    polluted by Cd, Hg, and Pb, and is moderately to strongly polluted by As at present.
    Contamination by heavy metals varied with economic development of Xinjiang Province.
    Between 1990 and 2010, anthropogenic accumulation of Cd, As, Pb and Hg increased
    from 4.05 to 7.30 ng/cm2/y, 0.27–0.98 μg/cm2/y, 0.21–0.39 μg/cm2/y and 0.61–0.83 ng/cm2/y,
    respectively. Furthermore, the 206Pb/207Pb ratio demonstrates that coal burning
    emissions and Pb in vehicle gasoline were major sources of heavy metal pollution
    in the Tianshan Mountains region.
