  abstract: 'The analysis of lead (Pb) in lake-sediment cores is a useful method to
    reconstruct                 local histories of Pb pollution. Here, we use Pb concentration
    profiles from lake                 sediments to reconstruct local trajectories
    of pre-Colonial smelting from three                 metallurgical centres in the
    South American Andes: the Morococha mining district,                 Peru; the
    Bolivian Altiplano around Lake Titicaca; and the silver-mining                 centre
    of Potosí, Bolivia. The earliest evidence for Pb enrichment from                 smelting
    is on the Altiplano beginning ~AD 400, coincident with the rise of                 the
    pre-Incan Tiwanaku and Wari Empires. Coeval with the collapse of these Empires                 ~AD
    1000, there is a dramatic decrease in Pb pollution on the Altiplano,                 suggesting
    metallurgical activity was closely tied to the Tiwanaku state. In                 contrast,
    metallurgy at Morococha, Peru and Potosí, Bolivia began ~AD                 1000—1200,
    likely as the result of the diaspora generated by the                 collapses
    of Tiwanaku and Wari. The independent chronologies of these records                 suggest
    asynchronous metallurgical activity between mining centres, and local-scale                 control
    of mineral resources. Following Inca conquest of the Andes ~AD 1450, strong                 increases
    in Pb are noted at all three study sites, suggesting an increase in silver                 production
    to meet Inca imperial demand. Following Hispanic conquest (AD 1532),                 large
    increases in Pb pollution are noted at Morococha and Potosí, only                 to
    be superseded by industrial development. The records presented here have                 implications
    for the reconstruction of Andean prehistory, and demonstrate the                 sensitivity
    of lake sediment geochemistry to pre-Colonial smelting activity. The                 technique
    has much potential for exploring the timing and magnitude of                 pre-industrial
    metallurgy in the New World.'
