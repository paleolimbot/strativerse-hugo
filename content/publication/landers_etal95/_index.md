  abstract: Global atmospheric concentrations of mercury (Hg) appear to be increasing
    and with it the potential for ecosystem exposure and ecological effects. From
    1990 to 1993 we examined U. S. arctic ecosystems over a broad spatial scale to
    develop baseline information on current concentrations of trace elements, heavy
    metals (including Hg), persistent organic compounds, and radionuclides in various
    components of the terrestrial and freshwater biosphere. Matrices reported here
    include, vegetation (lichens and mosses) and lake sediments. Total Hg in two lichen
    and two moss species from Alaska were generally low (0.02–0.112 μg/g dw), compared
    to reported values from other arctic locations and showed a statistically significant
    negative relationship between total Hg content and distance from the marine coastline.210Pb
    dated sediment cores indicated that average preindustrial total Hg accumulation
    rates were over four times greater in arctic Schrader lake than in subarctic Wonder
    Lake. Both lakes indicated a small increase (5–8%) in total Hg flux to the sediments
    during the last 145 years, much smaller than similar increases in total mercury
    for lakes in the north central U. S. The likely source of recent increases in
    Hg in these Alaskan ecosystems is long range atmospheric transport. While we can
    detect increases in mercury in lake sediments likely due to anthropogenic activities,
    values are low and there appears to be no immediate threat to terrestrial environments
    and inland freshwaters of arctic Alaska from long range atmospheric transport
    and deposition of Hg.
