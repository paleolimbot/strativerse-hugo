  abstract: Two sediment cores (BO90/13b and BO90/17b) from Lake Constance were investigated
    byγ-spectrometry for210Pb,134Cs,137Cs,241Am,234Th, and other members of the238U
    decay chain. The sediments were dated using the constant-flux model for210Pb,
    and accumulation rates were determined. These range from 0.04 to 0.65g/cm2/yr
    (BO90/13b) and 0.04 to 0.8g/cm2/yr (BO90/17b), respectively. The mean accumulation
    rate amounts to 0.16g/cm2/yr for both cores. The cores had already been dated
    by lamination counting and reconstruction of high-water events at the Limnological
    Institute at Constance, so that a very precise time scale was available. Both
    ages derived are in agreement within statistical error up to 1900, which means
    dating with the constant-flux model for210Pb was confirmed up to that age. The
    position of the maxima of bomb cesium and americium confirm the stratigraphic
    and210Pb datings. With241Am a further radioactive isotope is available, which
    can, due to the half-life of241Pu (t1/2=14.4yr) be detected now byγ-spectrometry
    and can serve as an additional time indicator, the maximum being dated at 1963.
    By applying the various time scales, the depth profiles of stable lead and zinc
    of core BO90/13b were dated. Both heavy metals show a very significant maximum
    located beneath the layer of the maxima of bomb cesium and americium, showing
    that these maxima are older than those of the bomb isotopes. It is remarkable
    in this context that the maximum of zinc concentration occurs a little later than
    that of stable lead. Similar concentration profiles are observable in core BO90/17b
    and other, older sediment cores (CS6-CS10) on a transect across the lake. In contrast
    to a former assumption, the depth profile of stable lead in Lake Constance sediments
    does not reflect the anthropogenic gasoline lead emissions into the atmosphere
    for Germany, their maximum being dated at 1971.
