  abstract: Sediments in Lake Izabal, Guatemala, contain substantial lead (Pb), zinc
    (Zn), and nickel (Ni). The lack of historical data for heavy metal concentrations
    in the sediments makes it difficult to determine the sources or evaluate whether
    inputs of metals to the lake have changed through time. We measured the relative
    abundances and concentrations of Pb, Zn, and Ni by X-Ray Fluorescence core scanning
    and by Inductively Coupled Plasma Optical Emission Spectrometry in three sediment
    cores to explore stratigraphic distributions of metals in the lake deposits. High
    amounts of Pb and Zn in the core taken near the Polochic Delta suggest that galena
    and sphalerite mining increased Pb and Zn delivery to Lake Izabal between ~1945
    and 1965 CE. An up-core Ni increase in the core taken near a different mine on
    the north shore of Lake Izabal suggests that recent nickel mining operations led
    to an increase in Ni concentrations in the local sediments, but amounts in the
    other cores indicate that Ni is not widely distributed throughout the lake. Sediment
    cores from Lake Izabal are reliable recorders of heavy metal input to the lake,
    and were measured to establish background metal levels, which would otherwise
    be unavailable. Concentrations of Pb, Zn, and Ni in older, pre-20th-century Lake
    Izabal sediments reflect input from natural erosion of bedrock. Our results provide
    previously unavailable estimates of background metal concentrations in Lake Izabal
    before the onset of mining. These results are necessary for future monitoring
    related to mining contamination of the lake ecosystem.
