  abstract: 'Mercury concentrations are clearly elevated in the surface and sub-surface
    layers of peat cores collected from a minerotrophic (“groundwater-fed”) fen in
    southern Greenland (GL) and an ombrotrophic (“rainwater-fed”) bog in Denmark (DK).
    Using 14C to precisely date samples since ca. AD 1950 using the “atmospheric bomb
    pulse,” the chronology of Hg accumulation in GL is remarkably similar to the bog
    in DK where Hg was supplied only by atmospheric deposition: this suggests not
    only that Hg has been supplied to the surface layers of the minerotrophic core
    (GL) primarily by atmospheric inputs, but also that the peat cores have preserved
    a consistent record of the changing rates of atmospheric Hg accumulation. The
    lowest Hg fluxes in the GL core (0.3 to 0.5 μg/m2/yr) were found in peats dating
    from AD 550 to AD 975, compared to the maximum of 164 μg/m2/yr in AD 1953. Atmospheric
    Hg accumulation rates have since declined, with the value for 1995 (14 μg/m2/yr)
    comparable to the value for 1995 obtained by published studies of atmospheric
    transport modelling (12 μg/m2/yr). The greatest rates of atmospheric Hg accumulation
    in the DK core are also found in the sample dating from AD 1953 and are comparable
    in magnitude (184 μg/m2/yr) to the GL core; again, the fluxes have since gone
    into strong decline. The accumulation rates recorded by the peat core for AD 1994
    (14 μg/m2/yr) are also comparable to the value for 1995 obtained by atmospheric
    transport modelling (18 μg/m2/yr). Comparing the Pb/Ti and As/Ti ratios of the
    DK samples with the corresponding crustal ratios (or “natural background values”
    for preanthropogenic peat) shows that the samples dating from 1953 also contain
    the maximum concentration of “excess” Pb and As. The synchroneity of the enrichments
    of all three elements (Hg, Pb, and As) suggests a common source, with coal-burning
    the most likely candidate. Independent support for this interpretation was obtained
    from the Pb isotope data (206Pb/207Pb = 1.1481 ± 0.0002 in the leached fraction
    and 1.1505 ± 0.0002 in the residual fraction) which is too radiogenic to be explained
    in terms of gasoline lead alone, but compares well with values for U.K. coals.
    In contrast, the lowest values for 206Pb/207Pb in the DK profile (1.1370 ± 0.0003
    in the leached fraction and 1.1408 ± 0.0003 in the residual fraction) are found
    in the sample dating from AD 1979: this shows that the maximum contribution of
    leaded gasoline occurred approximately 25 yr after the zenith in total anthropogenic
    Pb deposition.'
