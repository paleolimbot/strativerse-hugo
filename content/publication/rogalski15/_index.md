  abstract: Many taxa, from plants to zooplankton, produce long-lasting dormant propagules
    capable of temporal dispersal. In some cases, propagules can persist for decades
    or even centuries before emerging from seed and egg banks. Despite impressive
    longevity, relatively little is known about how the chemical environment experienced
    before or during dormancy affects the fate and performance of individuals. This
    study examines the hatching rate and developmental success of Daphnia hatched
    from diapausing eggs isolated from sediments from four lakes that experienced
    varying levels of metal contamination. Two hundred seventy-three animals were
    hatched from lake sediments deposited over the past century. Hatching rate was
    negatively influenced by metal contamination and sediment age. There was a robust
    positive relationship between sediment metal concentrations and juvenile mortality
    in Daphnia hatching from those sediments. The negative effect of metals on Daphnia
    hatching and juvenile survival may stem from metal bioaccumulation, genetic effects,
    or reduced maternal investment in diapausing embryos. Regardless of the specific
    mechanism driving this trend, exposure to metals may impose strong selection on
    Daphnia diapausing egg banks.
