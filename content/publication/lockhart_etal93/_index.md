  abstract: Sediment cores were taken from two isolated Canadian lakes, a southern
    lake in the boreal forest region of northwestern Ontario and a northern one in
    the tundra on the west coast of Hudson Bay, for the purpose of comparing current
    and historical loadings of several contaminants. There are no sources of anthropogenic
    contaminants within either basin, yet both lakes showed increases in polycyclic
    aromatic hydrocarbon and mercury in more recent sediments as compared with older,
    deeper sediments. We have interpreted these as indications of increased loadings
    as a result of atmospheric fallout. When compared on the basis of the sum of sixteen
    PAHs, both lakes showed peak inputs in the middle years of this century, followed
    by more recent declines; although current values still exceed those from deep
    slices. With respect to mercury, the concentrations found in the southern lake
    were somewhat higher than those in the northern lake, and loadings were clearly
    greater in the south. Both lakes showed enrichment of mercury in top layers of
    the cores relative to bottom layers, and this enrichment was proportionately greater
    in the north. Both mercury profiles showed a slow rate of increase for a long
    period before 1850, suggesting influences from areas industrialized before North
    America. The northern lake also showed increases in PAH loadings prior to 1850,
    but the southern lake did not.
