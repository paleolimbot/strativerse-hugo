  abstract: Lakes with complex morphologies and with different geologic and land-use
    characteristics in their sub-watersheds could have large differences in natural
    and anthropogenic chemical inputs to sub-basins in the lake. Lake Mead in southern
    Nevada and northern Arizona, USA, is one such lake. To assess variations in chemical
    histories from 1935 to 1998 for major sub-basins of Lake Mead, four sediment cores
    were taken from three different parts of the reservoir (two from Las Vegas Bay
    and one from the Overton Arm and Virgin Basin) and analyzed for major and trace
    elements, radionuclides, and organic compounds. As expected, anthropogenic contaminant
    inputs are greatest to Las Vegas Bay reflecting inputs from the Las Vegas urban
    area, although concentrations are low compared to sediment quality guidelines
    and to other USA lakes. One exception to this pattern was higher Hg in the Virgin
    Basin core. The Virgin Basin core is located in the main body of the lake (Colorado
    River channel) and is influenced by the hydrology of the Colorado River, which
    changed greatly with completion of Glen Canyon Dam upstream in 1963. Major and
    trace elements in the core show pronounced shifts in the early 1960s and, in many
    cases, gradually return to concentrations more typical of pre-1960s by the 1980s
    and 1990s, after the filling of Lake Powell. The Overton Arm is the sub-basin
    least effected by anthropogenic contaminant inputs but has a complex 137Cs profile
    with a series of large peaks and valleys over the middle of the core, possibly
    reflecting fallout from nuclear tests in the 1950s at the Nevada Test Site. The
    137Cs profile suggests a much greater sedimentation rate during testing which
    we hypothesize results from greatly increased dust fall on the lake and Virgin
    and Muddy River watersheds. The severe drought in the southwestern USA during
    the 1950s might also have played a role in variations in sedimentation rate in
    all of the cores.
