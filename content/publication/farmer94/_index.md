  abstract: The chemical record in Loch Lomond sediments deposited since the end of
    the last Ice Age provides evidence of the Flandrian marine transgression some
    5500â€“7000 14C years B.P., sedimentation rates and the influence of man's local
    activities, environmental pollution and its sources since the onset of the Industrial
    Revolution, and of elemental mobility linked with the reduction-diffusion-oxidation
    cycle of early sedimentary diagenesis. Information derived from vertical profiles
    of halogen elements bromine and iodine, radionuclides 14C and 210Pb, heavy metals
    lead, zinc, and cadmium, stable lead isotopes 206Pb and 207Pb, and redox-sensitive
    elements manganese, iron and arsenic is reviewed and assessed.
