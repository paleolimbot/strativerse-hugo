  abstract: Concentrations of 18 elements, including Sb, In, Sn, and Bi, were measured
    in sediment cores from two pristine alpine lakes on Mount Hachimantai, northern
    Japan, representing the past 250years. Vertical variations in concentrations are
    better explained by atmospheric metal deposition than by diagenetic redistribution
    of Fe and Mn hydroxide and organic matter. Anthropogenic metal fluxes were estimated
    from 210Pb-derived accumulation rates and metal concentrations in excess of the
    Al-normalized mean background concentration before 1850. Anthropogenic fluxes
    of Sb and In showed gradual increases starting around 1900 in both lakes, and
    marked increases after 1980. Comparison of Sb/Pb and Pb stable isotope ratios
    in sediments with those in aerosols of China or northern Japan and Japanese source
    materials (recent traffic- and incinerator-derived dust) suggest that the markedly
    elevated Sb flux after 1980 resulted primarily from enhanced long-range transport
    in aerosols containing Sb and Pb from coal combustion on the Asian continent.
    The fluxes of In, Sn, and Bi which are present in Chinese coal showed increasing
    trends similar to Sb for both study lakes. This suggests that the same source
    although incinerators in Japan may not be ruled out as sources of In. The sedimentary
    records for the last 250years indicate that atmospheric pollution of Sb and In
    in East Asia have intensified during recent decades.
