  abstract: The increasing vehicle traffic associated with urban sprawl in the United
    States is frequently linked to degradation of air quality, but its effect on aquatic
    sediment is less well-recognized. This study evaluates trends in PAHs, a group
    of contaminants with multiple urban sources, in sediment cores from 10 reservoirs
    and lakes in six U.S. metropolitan areas. The watersheds chosen represent a range
    in degree and age of urbanization. Concentrations of PAHs in all 10 reservoirs
    and lakes increased during the past 20âˆ’40 years. PAH contamination of the most
    recently deposited sediment at all sites exceeded sediment-quality guidelines
    established by Environment Canada, in some cases by several orders of magnitude.
    These results add a new chapter to the story told by previous coring studies that
    reported decreasing concentrations of PAHs after reaching highs in the 1950s.
    Concurrent with the increase in concentrations is a change in the assemblage of
    PAHs that indicates the increasing trends are driven by combustion sources. The
    increase in PAH concentrations tracks closely with increases in automobile use,
    even in watersheds that have not undergone substantial changes in urban land-use
    levels since the 1970s.
