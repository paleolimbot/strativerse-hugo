  abstract: Pollution and eutrophication of Chinese lakes are widely perceived to
    be 20th century phenomena. However, China has a long history of deforestation,
    agriculture, mineral resource extraction, and other anthropogenic activities that
    impact the environment. Here, we present a sediment record from Xing Yun Lake
    in the Yunnan Province of China that reveals significant alterations to the lake,
    its ecosystem, and its watershed beginning as early as 500 AD. A comprehensive
    suite of biogeochemical and isotopic proxies reveal several rapid transitions
    related to changes in agriculture and lake-level management that coincides with
    cultural and dynastic transitions. The deterioration of contemporary environmental
    conditions at Xing Yun arises from a long history of anthropogenic manipulation,
    eutrophication, and pollution of the lake and its watershed. This study highlights
    the importance of using historical records of industrial and agricultural activities,
    including landscape modification, in conjunction with records of climate change,
    to place present day environmental concerns into a long-term context.
