  abstract: 'Empirical field evidence for changing chemical processes in soils caused
    by atmospheric deposition of pollutants consists of: (1) Long-term water quality
    data including total dissolved solids, concentrations of specific metals (e.g.
    Ca), and conductivity; (2) Cation exchange capacity and base saturation values
    for soils located on precipitation pH gradients; (3) Lysimeter studies; and (4)
    Chemical analysis of organic soils on precipitation pH and metal gradients. For
    well-drained organic soils, as precipitation pH decreases, metals are differentially
    leached at an accelerated rate (Mn>Ca>Mg≥Zn>Cd and Na>Al). Experimental field
    and laboratory lysimeter studies on soil columns yield similar results, with increases
    in leaching rates for soil solutions with pH=3 up to 100 × values for soil solutions
    with pH=5. Nearly 100% of the Pb from precipitation is accumulating in the organic
    soil layer or sediments. Zn is accumulating in soils and sediments where the pH''s
    of precipitation, soil solutions, and surface waters are generally above 5 to
    5.5. At lower pH values Zn and other chemically similar elements are desorbed/leached
    (net) at an accelerated rate.Chemical analyses of dated sediment cores from high
    and low altitude lakes, with drainage basins relatively undisturbed for the last
    200+ yr, reveal that increased deposition of metals on a regional scale started
    in the northeastern United States as early as 1880, consistent with increased
    fossil fuel consumption. This suggests acidified precipitation as early as 1880.
    Cores from historically acidified lakes (pH<≈5.3 to 5.5) indicate that, as acidification
    of surface waters occurs (caused by acidic deposition), concentrations of Zn,
    Mn, and Ca decrease in the sediment. Apparently the metals are leached from the
    detritus prior to sedimentation. This conclusion results from data from experimental
    acidification of sediment cores and the general observation that precipitation
    pH is generally ≥0.5 pH units lower than lake water pH. Accelerated leaching of
    soil in New England dates to earlier than 1900.'
