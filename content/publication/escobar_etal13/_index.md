  abstract: We examined the anthropogenic lead (Pb) burden that accumulated in sediment
    of lakes in the southeastern USA during the last ~150 years. Mining, smelting,
    agriculture, and fossil-fuel combustion are known to have contributed to Pb pollution
    in lakes of other regions. Few studies, however, have examined Pb sequestered
    in lakes of the southeastern USA, particulary peninsular Florida, which is subject
    to less continental atmospheric influence than other regions of the eastern USA.
    We obtained sediment cores from Little Lake Jackson and Little Lake Bonnet in
    Highlands County, Florida and used Pb isotopes in the records to identify principal
    sources of Pb contamination. The sediment records showed that changes in Pb concentration
    and isotope ratios correspond temporally with gasoline consumption in the USA,
    as well as with changes in lead ores used to produce leaded gasoline. Lead concentrations
    in the study lakes showed temporal variations that were similar to those found
    in peat records from east-central Florida. Isotope trends were similar to the
    mean USA atmospheric Pb deposition record, and to Pb isotope records from Bermuda
    and Atlantic corals. We modeled the isotopic composition of the anthropogenic
    Pb in lake sediments and found that the overall trend is controlled by Pb that
    was released during leaded gasoline combustion. There is, however, additional
    Pb at each site that comes from sources that are not fully represented by the
    natural, background Pb. Lead isotope ratios and Pb/arsenic (As) ratios provide
    evidence that Pb deposition in lakes during the middle 1900s might have been influenced
    by lead arsenate applications to golf courses, a source that is often ignored
    in Pb isotope studies. Isotope evidence confirms, however, that following cessation
    of commercial lead arsenate use in the 1960s, atmospheric alkyl lead was again
    the primary influence on Pb in sediments of the study lakes.
