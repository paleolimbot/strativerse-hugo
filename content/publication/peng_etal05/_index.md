  abstract: 'Two sediment cores recovered in the central part of Daihai Lake in north-central
    China were analysed at 2- to 4-cm intervals for grain-size distribution. Grain-size
    distributions of the lake sediments are inferred to be a proxy for past changes
    in East Asian monsoon precipitation, such that greater silt-size percentage and
    higher median grain size reflect increased monsoonal precipitation rates. The
    grain-size record of Daihai Lake sediments spanning the last ca 10,000 yr indicates
    that the monsoonal precipitation in the lake region can be divided into three
    stages: the Early, Middle and Late Holocene. During the Early Holocene before
    ca 7900 cal yr BP, the median grain size (Md) and the silt-fraction content were
    relatively low and constant, suggesting relatively low precipitation over the
    lake region. The Middle Holocene between ca 7900 and 3100 cal yr BP was marked
    by intensified and highly variable monsoonal precipitation, as indicated by high
    and variable Md values and silt contents of the lake sediments. During this period,
    average precipitation rate gradually increased from ca 7900 to 6900 cal yr BP,
    displayed intense oscillations between ca 6900 and 4400 cal yr BP, and exhibited
    a decreasing trend while fluctuating from ca 4400 to 3100 cal yr BP. Although
    generally high during the Middle Holocene, both the Md and the silt content assumed
    distinctly low values at the short intervals of ca 6500–6400, 6000–5900, 5700–5600,
    4400–4200 cal yr BP, implying that monsoonal precipitation might have been significantly
    reduced during these intervals. During the Late Holocene since ca 3100 cal yr
    BP, grain-size values suggest that precipitation decreased. However, during the
    Late Holocene, relatively higher Md values and silt contents occurring between
    ca 1700 to 1000 cal yr BP may denote an intensification of hydrological cycles
    in the lake area. Changes in the East Asian monsoonal precipitation were not only
    directly linked with the changing seasonality of solar insolation resulting from
    progressive changes in the Earth''s orbital parameters, but also may have been
    closely related to variations in the temperature and size of the Western Pacific
    Warm Pool, in the intensity of the El Nino–Southern Oscillation, and in the path
    and strength of the North Equatorial Current in the western Pacific.'
