  abstract: Land cover transformations have accompanied the rise and fall of civilizations
    for thousands of years, exerting strong influence on the surrounding environment.
    Soil erosion and the associated outwash of nutrients are a main cause of eutrophication
    of aquatic ecosystems. Despite the great challenges of water protection in the
    face of climate change, large uncertainties remain concerning the timescales for
    recovery of aquatic ecosystems impacted by hypoxia. This study seeks to address
    this issue by investigating the sedimentary record of Lake Murten (Switzerland),
    which witnessed several phases of intensive human land-use over the past 2000
    years. Application of geophysical and geochemical methods to a 10 m-long sediment
    core revealed that soil erosion increased drastically with the rise of the Roman
    City of Aventicum (30 CE). During this period, the radiocarbon age of the bulk
    sedimentary organic carbon (OC) increasingly deviated from the modeled deposition
    age, indicating rapid flushing of old soil OC from the surrounding catchment driven
    by intensive land-use. Enhanced nutrient delivery resulted in an episode of cultural
    eutrophication, as shown by the deposition of varved sediments. Human activity
    drastically decreased towards the end of the Roman period (3rd century CE), resulting
    in land abandonment and renaturation. Recovery of the lake ecosystem from bottom-water
    hypoxia after the peak in human activity took around 50 years, while approximately
    300 years passed until sediment accumulation reached steady state conditions on
    the surrounding landscape. These findings suggest that the legacy of anthropogenic
    perturbation to watersheds may persist for centuries.
