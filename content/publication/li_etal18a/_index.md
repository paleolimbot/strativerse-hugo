  abstract: Long-term trends of sediment compositions are important for assessing
    the impact of human activities on the sediment and protecting the sediment environment.
    In this study, based on the contents of heavy metals and the Pb isotope ratios
    in lake sediments, atmospheric dustfall and soil in Yixing, China, the representative
    heavy metals (Zn, Pb, Cr and Cd) in lake sediments from western Taihu Lake were
    studied. The evolution history of heavy metals in the local environment was constructed
    for the past 100 years. From 1892 to the 1990s, the anthropogenic fluxes of the
    representative heavy metals were negligible, indicating minimal anthropogenic
    emissions of heavy metals. Since the 1990s, anthropogenic fluxes of the representative
    heavy metals began to increase, concurrent with the economic growth and development
    in the western Taihu Lake Basin after the Chinese economic reform. The maximum
    flux percentage of the heavy metals in the sediments, caused by human activities,
    is 23.0% for Zn, 31.6% for Pb, 39.5% for Cr and 85.3% for Cd, indicating that
    most of the Cd comes from human activities. The Cd content in the western Taihu
    Lake Basin was significantly higher than that in the other areas, and the rapid
    development of the industry in the western Taihu Lake Basin and ceramics in Yixing
    led to the enrichment of heavy metals in local sediments. Since the 21st century,
    measures have been taken to control the pollution of heavy metals, including the
    increase in local government attention and the deployment of environmental monitoring
    technology. However, heavy metal content remains high, and the Pb content is still
    increasing. The ratios of Pb isotopes show that the main sources of heavy metals
    in the western Taihu Lake sediments, the local soil of Yixing and the atmospheric
    dustfall are coal combustion, leaded gasoline combustion, industrial wastewater
    and domestic sewage.
