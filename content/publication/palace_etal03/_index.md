  abstract: The mobility of arsenic in freshwater systems is dictated by its partitioning
    between the solid and dissolved fractions in the sediments and their interstitial
    waters. Arsenic is largely associated with ferric iron in the form of oxyhydroxides
    in oxic waters and sediments as arsenate As (V). In deeper anaerobic sediments
    arsenic is released from iron oxyhydroxides because of the reduction of iron from
    the ferric to the more soluble ferrous state. Reducing environments can also be
    encountered in sediments relatively close to the sediment-water interface when
    there are high rates of biological activity that consume oxygen and create a reducing
    environment. For the past several years we have examined the relationships between
    organic carbon content of surface sediments, bottom water anoxia, redox zonation
    of sediments and the release of arsenic from freshwater sediments to the overlying
    waters. These studios have been performed using limnocorrals to isolate columns
    of water and their underlying sediments in Balmer Lake, a shallow freshwater system
    in Central Canada that has served as the final repository for tailings from two
    gold mines for more than 40 years. Our results indicate that surface sediments
    with higher organic carbon content are more susceptible to developing late season
    bottom water anoxia that can facilitate the subsequent release of arsenic from
    sediments to the overlying water. These results have implications for metal mining
    operations where reduced metal loadings from effluents or mine closure are expected
    to result in higher biological productivity and greater organic matter deposition
    to sediments.
