  abstract: The inundation of terrestrial vegetation following landscape flooding
    is an important potential source of mercury to aquatic ecosystems, and may modify
    mercury cycling, such as through increased methylation. In the Great Slave Lowlands
    of Canadaâ€™s Northwest Territories, remarkable landscape flooding has occurred
    over the recent past, which is the most notable in at least the last several centuries.
    The potential for this flooding to increase inorganic mercury flux to the lakes
    of the region has not yet been explored. In this study we used sediment cores
    from five lakes experiencing a range of recently documented lake expansion to
    test whether inundation of terrestrial areas has increased the total mercury concentrations
    in sediments, and resulted in increased total mercury flux. Increases in sedimentary
    mercury concentrations and fluxes in sediment cores from the expanding lakes were
    relatively small and within the range of non-expanded systems, suggesting that,
    to date, flooding has not resulted in major total mercury enrichment, unlike in
    experimental and natural reservoir impoundments. The potential for increased methylation
    of existing inorganic mercury following expansion was not explored in this paper
    because methylmercury is dynamic in sediments and does not preserve well, but
    is an important consideration for future work.
