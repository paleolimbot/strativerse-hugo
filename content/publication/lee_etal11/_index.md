  abstract: A long-term record, extending back 800years (1205 to 2002AD), of the Pb
    isotopic composition (206Pb/207Pb and 208Pb/207Pb) as well as Pb concentrations
    from high altitude Mt. Everest ice cores has the potential to identify sources
    and source regions affecting natural and anthropogenic Pb deposition in central
    Asia. The results show that the regional natural background Pb isotope signature
    (~1.20 for 206Pb/207Pb and ~2.50 for 208Pb/207Pb) in the central Himalayas was
    dominated by mineral dust over the last ~750years from 1205 to 1960s, mostly originating
    from local sources with occasional contributions of long-range transported dust
    probably from Sahara desert and northwestern India. Since the 1970s, the Pb isotope
    ratios are characterized by a continuous decline toward less radiogenic ratios
    with the least mean ratios of 1.178 for 206Pb/207Pb and 2.471 for 208Pb/207Pb
    in the period 1990â€“1996. The depression of the 206Pb/207Pb and 208Pb/207Pb values
    during the corresponding periods is most likely due to an increasing influence
    of less radiogenic Pb of anthropogenic origin mainly from leaded gasoline used
    in South Asia (India as well as possibly Bangladesh and Nepal). From 1997 to 2002,
    isotopic composition tends to show a shift to slightly more radiogenic signature.
    This is likely attributed to reducing Pb emissions from leaded gasoline in source
    regions, coinciding with the nationwide reduction of Pb in gasoline and subsequent
    phase-out of leaded gasoline in South Asia since 1997. An interesting feature
    is the relatively high levels of Pb concentrations and enrichment factors (EF)
    between 1997 and 2002. Although the reason for this feature remains uncertain,
    it would be probably linked with an increasing influence of anthropogenic Pb emitted
    from other sources such as fossil fuel combustion and non-ferrous metal production.
