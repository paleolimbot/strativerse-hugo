  abstract: Lead, zinc, copper, chromium, arsenic and cadmium were measured in a sediment
    core from southern Loch Lomond for which 210Pb dating indicated a sedimentation
    rate of 22±2 mg/cm2/yr corresponding to a mean accumulation rate of 0.36 mm/yr.
    While copper and chromium were enriched to only a minor extent, the lead, zinc,
    arsenic and cadmium concentrations were markedly enhanced in upper sections. Increasing
    anthropogenic input associated with industrial activity centred on Glasgow seems
    responsible for the vertical distribution of lead, zinc and cadmium but a high
    0–1 cm level of arsenic (474 μg/g), strongly correlated with enhanced iron content
    in the surface oxidising layer of sediment, appears attributable to post-depositional
    diagenetic mobilisation and upward migration in the reducing zone of the sediment
    column. Leaching, using CH3CO2H/NH2OH·HCl, released over 90% and 80% of the common
    metal pollutants, lead and zinc, from surface sediment. Onset of an approximately
    tenfold increase in lead and zinc concentrations above “background” levels of
    13±2 μg/g and 47±13 μg/g to upper section levels of 140–170 μg/g and 450–460 μg/g
    respectively was placed at late-18th century, in accord with the records of the
    commencement of significant industrial activity in the Glasgow area. Current anthropogenic
    fluxes (μg/cm2 /yr) of lead (2.51±0.34) and zinc (8.84±1.20) to the sediment are
    in agreement with recent atmospheric deposition data for the adjoining Clyde Sea
    Area. The general concordance between anthropogenic metal fluxes to Loch Lomond
    sediment and atmospheric deposition fluxes endorses the potential usefulness of
    Loch Lomond sediment data to the resolution of pollution sources in the adjoining
    sea lochs and firth of the Clyde Sea Area, illustrated here through consideration
    of the comparative distribution of chromium in relation to its historical use.
