  abstract: A 268 cm section of sediment core from Liangzhi Lake in Hubei province
    in central China was used to assess the use and accumulation of metals in the
    lake in the past 7,000 years. The concentrations of trace metals, including Cu,
    Pb, Ni, and Zn, and major elements, Ca, Fe, and Mg, in a 14C- dated segment of
    sediment core were analyzed. Historical trends on the input of metals to Liangzhi
    Lake from around 5000 BC to the present were recorded in the sediments, representing
    about 7,000 years of history on the mining and utilization of metals in central
    China. The concentrations of Cu, Ni, Pb, and Zn increased gradually from about
    3000 ± 328 BC, indicating the start of the Bronze Age in ancient China. During
    the period 467 ± 257 to 215 ± 221 AD, there was a rapid increase in the concentrations
    of these metals in the sediments, indicating enormous inputs of these metals at
    that time. This era corresponded to China’s Warring States Period (475− 221 BC)
    and the early Han Dynasty (206 BC−220 AD), during which copper and lead were extensively
    used in making bronze articles such as vessels, tools, and weapons. From 1880
    ± 35 AD to the early 1900s, there was also a significant increase in the concentrations
    of metals such as Cu, Ni, and Pb, which probably reflected the metal emissions
    and utilization during the early period of industrial development and weapon manufacture
    during the wars in China. The Pb isotopic analysis showed that the surface and
    subsurface sediments had lower 206Pb/207Pb and 208Pb/207Pb ratios than the deeper
    layers, reflecting the additional input of Pb from mining activities that took
    place during the Bronze Age era and in modern times. This study provides direct
    evidence of the environmental impact of the mining and utilization of metals in
    the last 7,000 years in one of the important regions of Chinese civilization.
