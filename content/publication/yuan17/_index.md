  abstract: Concentrations of aluminum, arsenic, barium, beryllium, cadmium, calcium,
    chromium, cobalt, copper, iron, lead, magnesium, manganese, molybdenum, nickel,
    potassium, selenium, sodium, tin, titanium, vanadium, and zinc were measured in
    a surface sediment core from the Sandusky basin of Lake Erie to detail the history
    of hydrological and environmental changes back to 1800. The results from hierarchical
    cluster and principal component analyses revealed four elemental groups. All the
    trace elements clustering with aluminum, iron, and manganese in Group I were enriched
    due to increased inputs from anthropogenic sources. The two conservative elements
    sodium and potassium clustering in Group II showed patterns of changes like those
    of water-level fluctuations. The two carbonate elements calcium and magnesium
    clustering in Group III showed intriguing but complex carbonate biogeochemistry
    associated with biogenic production, organic acid-induced dissolution and dilution
    by organic and aluminosilicate materials. The terrigenous element titanium in
    Group IV experienced two stages of depletion from increased organic fluxes in
    the 1820s and 1950s. Following the enactments of stringent regulations in the
    early 1970s, many of these elemental inputs have reduced considerably. But the
    concurrent reductions in the Sandusky basin were much slower than previously thought.
    Large increases in inputs from local storages (internal loading) were required
    to account for the slow reductions. The increased internal loading was caused
    by augmented organic materials from accelerated eutrophication which facilitated
    the transfer, transport, and cycling of many trace metals. This work has implications
    in ongoing research efforts to tackle the eutrophication problem because the complex
    ecosystem including the internal loading has changed considerably over the past
    two centuries.
