  abstract: Sediment cores from eight headwater lakes located in Southern Québec,
    Eastern Canada, were analyzed for Pb, stable Pb isotopes, and the radioelements
    210Pb, 137Cs, 241Am and 226Ra. The depth profiles of stable Pb isotope ratios
    show, for the post-19th century period, the influence of several isotopically
    distinct anthropogenic lead sources, mainly including emissions from two Canadian
    smelters and from leaded gasoline combustion in Canada and in the United States.
    A most interesting feature of the profiles, however, is the presence of sharp
    stable Pb isotope ratio peaks near the depth horizon, where excess 210Pb becomes
    undetectable. Using a binary mixing model and assuming that natural Pb concentrations
    and isotopic compositions from the catchment are given by the pre-industrial sediments
    at the bottom of the cores, we find that a significant part of the anthropogenic
    Pb supplied to the sediments at this horizon originated from smelting activities
    in the Upper Mississippi Valley. We assess that the Pb isotope ratio peaks, also
    observed in the laminated sediments of the Pettaquamscutt Estuary, Rhode Island,
    USA, are an accurate chronostratigraphic marker for the validation of mid-19th
    century 210Pb-derived dates. Given that the study lakes are located up to 2000km
    from the Mississippi Valley, we conclude that this isotopic Pb signal provides
    a widely distributed time-marker that is key to validate 210Pb chronologies in
    environmental archives from Eastern North America.
