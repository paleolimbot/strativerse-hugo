  abstract: Town Lake, the last in the chain of Highland Lakes on the Colorado River,
    runs through the center of Austin, Texas. On any given day, grebes and coots dot
    the water, rowers skim alongside, and the sparkle of the sun on the water can
    be admired from the adjacent hike and bike path and from the windows of nearby
    office buildings. During the summer months, crowds gather along the shores of
    Town Lake to watch as many as 1 million Mexican Free-Tail bats emerge from under
    the Congress Avenue bridge. But below the lazily moving azure water lies a bed
    of sediment about 1 meter (m) thick?sediment that has been deposited gradually
    since the reservoir was formed in 1959 and that has been recording changes in
    water quality since that time. What can this sediment tell us about the history
    of water quality in the Colorado River? And what does it say about the effects
    of the rapid urbanization of Austin and the future health of our environment?
