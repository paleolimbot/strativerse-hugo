  abstract: 'We evaluated anthropogenic Pb deposition along a west-east transect from
    the Adirondack Mountains, New York, USA (ADIR) region, the Vermont-New Hampshire-Maine,
    USA (VT-NH-ME) region, and Nova Scotia, Canada (NS) region using 47 210Pb-dated
    lake sediment records. We used focus-corrected Pb inventories to evaluate cumulative
    deposition and breakpoint analysis to evaluate possible differences in timings
    among regions. Peak Pb concentrations decreased from west to east (ADIR region:
    52–378 mg kg−1, VT-NH-ME region: 54–253 mg kg−1, NS: 38–140 mg kg−1). Cumulative
    deposition of anthropogenic Pb also decreased from west to east (ADIR region:
    791–1344 mg m−2, VT-NH-ME region: 209–1206 mg m−2, NS: 52–421 mg m−2). The initiation
    of anthropogenic Pb deposition occurred progressively later along the same transect
    (ADIR region: 1869–1900, VT-NH-ME region: 1874–1905, NS region: 1901–1930). Previous
    lead isotope studies suggest that eastern Canadian Pb deposition over the past
    ~150 years has originated from a mix of both Canadian and U.S. sources. The results
    of this study indicate that anthropogenic Pb from sources west of the ADIR region
    were deposited in lesser amounts from west to east and/or Pb sources reflect less
    population density from west to east. The timing of the initiation of anthropogenic
    Pb deposition in the NS region suggests that Pb from gasoline may be an important
    source in this region.'
