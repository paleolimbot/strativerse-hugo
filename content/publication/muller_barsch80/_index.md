  abstract: Geochemical investigations of a sediment core from a high Arctic lake
    (Access Lake, Ellesmere Island, N.W.T., Canada) revealed a heavy metal distribution
    pattern which is similar to those found in sediment profiles in more polluted
    areas. A long‐range transport of anthropogenic heavy metals via atmospheric dust—as
    already reported from snow and ice in polar regions — is assumed to be the source
    of the heavy metal accumulation in Access Lake.
