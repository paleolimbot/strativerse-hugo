  abstract: 'This study assessed historical changes in metal concentrations in sediments
    of southern Lake Macquarie resulting from the activities of coal-fired power stations,
    using a multi-proxy approach which combines 210Pb, 137Cs and metal concentrations
    in sediment cores. Metal concentrations in the lake were on average, Zn: 67mg/kg,
    Cu: 15mg/kg, As: 8mg/kg, Se: 2mg/kg, Cd: 1.5mg/kg, Pb: 8mg/kg with a maximum of
    Zn: 280 mg/kg, Cu: 80 mg/kg, As: 21 mg/kg, Se: 5 mg/kg, Cd: 4 mg/kg, Pb: 48 mg/kg.
    The ratios of measured concentrations in sediment cores to their sediment guidelines
    were Cd 1.8, As 1.0, Cu 0.5, Pb 0.2 and Zn 0.2, with the highest concern being
    for cadmium. Of special interest was assessment of the effects of changes in ash
    handling procedures by the Vales Point power station on the metal concentrations
    in the sediments. Comparing sediment layers before and after ash handling procedures
    were implemented, zinc concentrations have decreased 10%, arsenic 37%, selenium
    20%, cadmium 38% and lead 14%. An analysis of contaminant depth profiles showed
    that, after implementation of new ash handling procedures in 1995, selenium and
    cadmium, the main contaminants in Australian black coal had decreased significantly
    in this estuary.'
