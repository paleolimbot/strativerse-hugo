  abstract: The environmental ramifications of rapid development on the functioning
    of warm tropical freshwater ecosystems are poorly understood. Here, a multi-proxy
    palaeolimnological approach is used to examine the nature and degree of anthropogenic
    environmental change in a tropical lowland reservoir in Singapore. Singapore has
    undergone a dramatic transformation over the past century, transitioning from
    a country with a largely agrarian landscape to one that is highly urbanised. Two
    radiometrically dated sediment cores were retrieved from one of the country’s
    oldest reservoirs and analysed for spheroidal carbonaceous particles (SCPs), mercury
    (Hg), atomic carbon (C) and nitrogen (N), stable C and N isotopes (δ13C and δ15N),
    and diatoms. The sedimentary data show clear evidence of atmospheric pollution
    and nutrient enrichment as a result of human activities in Singapore and the region.
    During the early stages of Singapore’s development (1900s–1960s), the reservoir
    was minimally impacted and characterised by oligotrophic conditions. As the country
    began to industrialise and urbanise (1970s–1990s), the SCP data indicate increasing
    contamination by air pollutants derived from domestic sources of fossil fuel combustion,
    while the diatom, C/N, δ13C, and δ15N data suggest that the reservoir was becoming
    more productive, possibly from N depositions arising from an increase in electricity
    generation and a rapid expansion in transport infrastructure in Singapore. As
    the pace of development in Singapore slowed down (1990s–the present), the sedimentary
    data collectively indicate increasing depositions of atmospheric pollutants and
    nutrient enrichment mediated by a warming climate. A substantial component of
    increased atmospheric pollution is likely to be of distal, and thus transboundary,
    origin.
