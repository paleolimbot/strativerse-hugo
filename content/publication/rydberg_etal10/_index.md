  abstract: In sub-arctic and arctic regions mercury is an element of concern for
    both wildlife and humans. Over thousands of years large amounts of atmospherically
    deposited mercury, both from natural and anthropogenic sources, have been sequestered
    together with carbon in northern peatlands. Many of these peatlands are currently
    underlain by permafrost, which controls mire stability and hydrology. With the
    ongoing climate change there is concern that permafrost thawing will turn large
    areas of these northern peatlands from carbon/mercury-sinks into much wetter carbon/mercury-sources.
    Here we can show that such a change in mire structure in the sub-arctic Stordalen
    mire in northern Sweden actually is responsible for an increased export of mercury
    to the adjacent lake Inre Harrsjön. We also show that sediment mercury accumulation
    rates during a warm period in the pre-industrial past were higher than in the
    1970s when atmospheric input peaked, indicating that in areas with permafrost,
    climate can have an effect on mercury loading to lakes as large as anthropogenic
    emissions. Thawing of permafrost and the subsequent export of carbon is a widespread
    phenomenon, and the projection is that it will increase even more in the near
    future. Together with our observations from Stordalen, this makes northern peatlands
    into a substantial source of mercury, at risk of being released into sensitive
    arctic freshwater and marine systems.
