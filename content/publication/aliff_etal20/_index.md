  abstract: The Laurentian Great Lakes are the most studied system in lake geochemistry
    and have well-preserved chronological profiles. Metals play numerous critical
    roles in natural and anthropogenic characteristics of lake ecosystems, so patterns
    in the historical records of metals from sedimentary cores provide important information
    about environmental baselines and human impacts. Relevant studies of Great Lakes
    geochemistry are listed, and we follow with encyclopedic descriptions of metals
    and their oxides in the lakes. These descriptions include likely natural and anthropogenic
    sources of elements, their known history from previous paleoecological studies,
    and their status as potential contaminants of concern. Despite the well-studied
    geology of the Great Lakes catchment, sourcing elements was sometimes difficult
    due to materials often being moved long distances by glaciation and the global
    prevalence of atmospheric pollutants. We summarized available information on metals
    and their roles as geochemical indicators in the Great Lakes.
