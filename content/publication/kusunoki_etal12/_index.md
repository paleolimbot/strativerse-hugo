  abstract: The historical trend of heavy metal pollution recorded in sediment cores
    from Lake Shinji, western Japan, was investigated to evaluate the contribution
    of increasing long-range transport of heavy metals from the Asian continent in
    recent years. The concentrations of Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb, Sb, and Zn and lead
    isotope ratios were determined for sediment cores collected at two sites in the
    lake. Among the metals, Cd, Sb, and Zn showed markedly high concentrations since
    the 1970s. Moreover, a high Pb concentration and less radiogenic lead isotope
    ratios have been observed since the 1980s in the core from a site close to the
    mouth of a major river. Air masses from the Asian continent, including China,
    Russia, and South Korea, have less radiogenic lead isotope ratios than those from
    Japan. This suggests that the recent increase in Pb concentration in the sediment
    core is primarily due to the long-range transport of heavy metals from the Asian
    continent, followed by their deposition in the catchment area of the river. The
    concentration ratios of Pb/Cd, Pb/Sb, and Pb/Zn of the sediment around 2000 were
    calculated on the basis of the metal concentrations in excess of those before
    1940. They were then compared with the volume-weighted annual average concentration
    ratios of Pb/Cd, Pb/Sb, and Pb/Zn of rain samples collected on the shore of the
    lake for 1999â€“2001. The result showed that the ratios of the former to the latter
    are 1.0 for Cd, 0.69 for Sb, and 0.31 for Zn. Thus, it is likely that the long-range
    transport of Cd and Sb from the Asian continent also contributes significantly
    to the recent increase in the concentrations of these metals in the sediment core
    from Lake Shinji. For Zn, however, the contribution from the Asian continent was
    evaluated to be small, suggesting the importance of local sources such as effluent
    discharges.
