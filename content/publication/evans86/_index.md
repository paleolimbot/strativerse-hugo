  abstract: To determine the significance of mercury contamination of remote lakes
    in three regions of south-central Ontario, Canada, sediment cores were collected
    at several stations in each of fourteen lakes. Profiles of Hg concentration with
    depth were similar to those found in many parts of the world and indicate a substantial
    increase in Hg loading to these lakes in recent decades. Surficial sediment concentrations
    (0â€“2 cm) ranged from 120 to 700 ng/g dry matter.Whole-lake burdens of Hg, used
    to determine the source of the contamination, were similar for all lakes in the
    study. The average anthropogenic component of the burden for all lakes was 0.79
    mg/m2. This amount represents approximately one-half of the total burden in the
    sediments. There was a relationship between the size of a lake's catchment and
    the whole-lake burden of Hg in lakes in one region of the study area but not the
    remaining lakes. It is concluded that the major source of the Hg in the study
    lakes is atmospheric deposition of material originating from outside the catchments
    and that the contribution from catchment washout is variable.
