  abstract: A high-resolution geochemical profile from a 5,500-year-old sediment core
    of Lake Lehmilampi in eastern Finland was analyzed to study long-term trends and
    variability in element concentrations and accumulation rates. The accumulation
    rates of all studied elements followed the same trend, responding to changes in
    the total sedimentation rate. Concentration profiles differed among elements and
    showed considerable variation over time. Principal components analysis (PCA) was
    used on the concentration data to identify groups of elements that have similar
    geochemical controls. The first principal component was influenced by changes
    in mineral matter accumulation, and it incorporated elements that are associated
    with stable allochthonous minerals (such as Mg, K, Cs, Rb, Li, Ti and Ga), as
    well as elements in forms that become diluted when mineral matter increases (e.g.,
    S, Fe and Mn). The second and third principal components showed that a large proportion
    of the variance was accounted for by elements with continuously increasing or
    decreasing concentrations related to pedogenetical development of the catchment
    soil. In the case of Hg, Pb and Cd, however, accumulation rates increased faster
    at the surface than is simply accounted for by changes in total sedimentation
    rates. For Cu, Cr, Ni and Zn, concentrations increased over the past 150 years,
    but there were no indications of a significant addition due to atmospheric deposition.
    These elements had more variable concentrations before the mid nineteenth century
    than after, as did elements that are often used for normalization. These findings
    suggest that lake sediments may not properly reflect the history of atmospheric
    metal deposition in remote areas.
