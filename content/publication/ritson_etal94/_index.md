  abstract: Measurements of lead concentrations and stable lead isotopic compositions
    (204Pb, 206Pb, 207Pb, 208Pb) in sediment cores from Lake Erie document both temporal
    and spatial variations in lead sources to the lake. These analyses track the history
    of lead contamination in the lake, as well as the transport of particulate matter
    which governs the redistribution of particle-reactive contaminants within the
    lake. The isotopic compositions of the sediments reveal two sources of natural
    lead (fluvial and shoreline bluff erosion) and three primary sources of anthropogenic
    lead (coal combustion, gasoline additives, and municipal waste water discharges)
    to the lake. Lead concentrations and isotopic compositions of 210Pb-dated sediment
    cores record historical variations in the inputs from these sources. The heterogeneous
    isotopic composition of the three basins of Lake Erie indicates that lead from
    municipal effluent is most prominent in the urbanized western region of the lake
    and that atmospheric deposition is most prominent in the more rural eastern areas.
    Calculations based on a 207Pb206Pb vs. 208Pb206Pb linear mixing model show that
    as much as 70% of sediment in the Central Basin and 25% in the East Basin originates
    from the West Basin of Lake Erie. These calculations attest to the interbasinal
    redistribution of particle-reactive contaminants within the lake.
