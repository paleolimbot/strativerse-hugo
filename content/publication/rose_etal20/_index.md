  abstract: Naturally accumulating archives, such as lake sediments and wetland peats,
    in remote areas may be used to identify the scale and rates of atmospherically
    deposited pollutant inputs to natural ecosystems. Co-located lake sediment and
    wetland cores were collected from Letšeng-la Letsie, a remote lake in the Maloti
    Mountains of southern Lesotho. The cores were radiometrically dated and analysed
    for a suite of contaminants including trace metals and metalloids (Hg, Pb, Cu,
    Ni, Zn, As), fly-ash particles, stable nitrogen isotopes, polycyclic aromatic
    hydrocarbons (PAHs) and persistent organic pollutants such as polychlorinated
    biphenyls (PCBs), polybrominated flame retardants (PBDEs) and hexachlorobenzene
    (HCB). While most trace metals showed no recent enrichment, mercury, fly-ash particles,
    high molecular weight PAHs and total PCBs showed low but increasing levels of
    contamination since c.1970, likely the result of long-range transport from coal
    combustion and other industrial sources in the Highveld region of South Africa.
    However, back-trajectory analysis revealed that atmospheric transport from this
    region to southern Lesotho is infrequent and the scale of contamination is low.
    To our knowledge, these data represent the first palaeolimnological records and
    the first trace contaminant data for Lesotho, and one of the first multi-pollutant
    historical records for southern Africa. They therefore provide a baseline for
    future regional assessments in the context of continued coal combustion in South
    Africa through to the mid-21st century.
