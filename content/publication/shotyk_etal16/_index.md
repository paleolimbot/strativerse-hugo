  abstract: Peat cores were collected from six bogs in northern Alberta to reconstruct
    changes in the atmospheric deposition of Pb, a valuable tracer of human activities.
    In each profile, the maximum Pb enrichment is found well below the surface. Radiometric
    age dating using three independent approaches (14C measurements of plant macrofossils
    combined with the atmospheric bomb pulse curve, plus 210Pb confirmed using the
    fallout radionuclides 137Cs and 241Am) showed that Pb contamination has been in
    decline for decades. Today, the surface layers of these bogs are comparable in
    composition to the “cleanest” peat samples ever found in the Northern Hemisphere,
    from a Swiss bog ~ 6000 to 9000 years old. The lack of contemporary Pb contamination
    in the Alberta bogs is testimony to successful international efforts of the past
    decades to reduce anthropogenic emissions of this potentially toxic metal to the
    atmosphere.
