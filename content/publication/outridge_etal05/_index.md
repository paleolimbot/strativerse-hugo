  abstract: 'Varved (annually-laminated) sediments offer a rare and physically undisturbed
    archive of past trace metal deposition and limnological conditions. Here, a high-resolution
    1,300 year record of metal accumulation is presented from a varved lake sediment
    on Devon Island in the Canadian High Arctic. Down-core concentration profiles
    of Cd, Cu and Zn were positively correlated (P < 0.01) with organic C (Cd, Zn)
    or with leachable Fe (Cu), while distinct sub-surface peaks of these metals coincided
    with those of Fe, S and other redox-sensitive elements such as Co, Cr and U. The
    fluxes of these metals since 1854 were correlated with elements such as Ca, Al
    and La (P < 0.001) which are predominantly of local geological origin. Furthermore,
    the Cd, Cu and Zn patterns did not match concurrent records in Greenland Summit
    ice over the last century, nor global industrial emission histories. These facts
    suggest that inputs from local geological sources, coupled with some degree of
    post-depositional mobility or association with organic matter inputs, explain
    the metalsâ€™ sedimentary profiles, which were apparently not affected by long-range
    atmospheric metal pollution. Mercury concentrations were strongly correlated with
    total diatom abundance over the last 400 yrs, especially during the 20th Century
    when a two-fold increase in Hg concentrations and a four order-of-magnitude increase
    in diatoms occurred in tandem. Since 1854, 81% of the variation in Hg flux was
    associated with diatom and Ca fluxes. A similar correspondence between Hg and
    diatoms was found in a second lake nearby, confirming that the relationship was
    not unique to the main study lake. Recent Hg increases in Arctic and sub-Arctic
    lakes have been attributed to global anthropogenic Hg emissions. We propose an
    alternative hypothesis for High Arctic lakes: the recent Hg increases may be partly
    or entirely the product of elevated rates of Hg scavenging from the water column
    caused by markedly greater algal productivity, which in turn was driven by accelerating
    climate warming during the 20th Century. Given the important environmental assessment
    and policy implications if the alternative hypothesis is true, the possible effects
    of climate warming on sedimentary Hg fluxes in this region deserve further study.'
