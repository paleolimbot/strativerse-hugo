  abstract: 'A 650 cm core from a Swiss bog represents 12,370 14C years of peat accumulation
    and provides the first complete record of atmospheric Pb deposition for the entire
    Holocene. Excess, non-atmospheric Sr in the peat was calculated by normalizing
    Sr/Sc to crustal abundance; this was used to differentiate between the ombrogenic
    section of the bog in which inorganic solids are supplied exclusively by atmospheric
    deposition and the minerogenic zone where mineral-water interactions contribute
    metals to the peat. While sediment dissolution contributes significantly to the
    Sr inventory of the minerogenic section of the peat profile, there is no measurable
    effect of this process on the Pb burden. Isotopic analyses (204Pb, 206Pb, 207Pb,
    208Pb) show that effectively all of the Pb in the peat profile was supplied exclusively
    from the atmosphere. To separate natural and anthropogenic Pb, Sc was selected
    over Ti, Y, Zr, Hf and REE as a conservative, reference element which is supplied
    by soil dust aerosols derived from rock weathering. Enrichment factors (EF) were
    calculated using the Pb/Sc ratio in the peat samples, normalized to the “natural,
    background” Pb/Sc which is found in peats dating from 8030 to 5320 14C yr BP.
    The results show that anthropogenic source have dominated the supply of atmospheric
    Pb to the peat core continuously since 3000 14C yr BP. The aerosols supplied to
    the bog can be divided into 3 classes: a) Pre-Anthropogenic (older than 3000 14C
    yr BP with Pb EF < 2 and 206Pb/207Pb > 1.194); b) Pre-Industrial (dating from
    3000–240 14C yr BP, with Pb EF ≥ 2 but <20 and 206Pb/207Pb 1.193–1.179); c) Industrial
    (more recent than 240 14C yr BP, with Pb EF > 20 and 206Pb/207Pb < 1.179). Elevated
    soil dust fluxes are observed at 5320, 8230 and 10,590 14C yr BP; the latter corresponds
    to the Younger Dryas. Aluminum, Zr, Hf, and REE/Sc ratios also are elevated at
    the same depths, suggesting differences in particle size, wind strength, or source
    regions. Pre-Anthropogenic aerosols deposited since 8230 14C yr BP reveal Pb/Sc
    which is significantly higher, and 206Pb/207Pb which is less radiogenic, than
    during the early Holocene. While the trend toward increasing Pb/Sc could be due
    to chemical weathering and soil development, this could not explain the shift
    in Pb isotopic composition. The changes which took place at 8230 14C BP, therefore,
    may be related to a large scale climatic reorganization which, at present, is
    poorly understood.'
