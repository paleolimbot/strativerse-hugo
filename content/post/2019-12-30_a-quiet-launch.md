The Strativerse has been almost a year in the making and has been rewritten in various frameworks at least twice (the first version was written using [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/), [Python](https://www.python.org/), and [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/)...this version uses YAML, [Hugo](https://gohugo.io), and Javascript/[JQuery](https://jquery.com)). As of this writing, I've extracted records, features, and parameters from 230 publications, and identified 162 more that need to be entered (a number which grows every day). It will be another few months until any kind of official launch, but in the meantime, feel free to browse! You might also be interested in the [GitHub Source](https://github.com/paleolimbot/strativerse-hugo).
