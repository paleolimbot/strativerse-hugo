  abstract: Stable Pb isotope profiles in dated lake sediment cores were used to gauge
    the relative amounts and possible sources of anthropogenic Pb deposited from the
    atmosphere in different regions of the Canadian Arctic. A distinct north-south
    difference was found. In four High Arctic lakes (i.e., north of 66Â°N) in this
    study, recent Pb isotopic shifts or concentration increases attributable to anthropogenic
    Pb were negligible. The maximum possible contribution from anthropogenic Pb was
    0 to 19% of acid-leachable Pb in the 1980s or 1990s. In contrast, two lakes in
    the Hudson Bay region displayed significantly lower Pb isotope ratios and threefold
    to fivefold increases of Pb concentrations in modern sediments, corresponding
    to anthropogenic Pb inputs of at least 72 to 91% of leachable Pb. Eurasian urban
    and industrial Pb is known to dominate the High Arctic atmosphere. A possible
    explanation for its negligible influence on northern lake sediments is that atmospheric
    Pb deposition at northern latitudes is reduced compared with southern regions
    and is small compared to local geological inputs. 210Pb deposition declines with
    increasing latitude, apparently because of declining precipitation rates; stable
    Pb deposition may be similarly affected. Meteorological considerations and variations
    in the post-1900 Pb isotopic trajectories indicated that the predominant anthropogenic
    Pb source region in NW Hudson Bay was Eurasia, while in SE Hudson Bay, it was
    Canada and the United States, with a minor Eurasian component.
