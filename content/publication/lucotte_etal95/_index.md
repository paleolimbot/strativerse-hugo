  abstract: In a sub-Arctic region of the province of Québec, at sites situated 200
    to 1400 km away from the closest industrial centers, we find the ubiquitous presence
    of anthropogenic Hg, reflected by steadily increasing concentrations of this metal
    in lake sediments, since about 1940, to rates averaging 2.3 times the preindustrial
    levels. Mercury concentrations in lake sediments were found to be proportional
    to the amounts of terrestrial organic carbon from the catchment area. It would,
    therefore, be misleading to derive continental-scale gradients of this pollutant
    based on Hg concentrations in oligotrophic lake sediments, unless they are normalized
    to their organic carbon content. Our normalized data for sediments of remote lakes
    along a 1200 km transect (45 to 55°N) clearly indicate that the distribution pattern
    of long-range Hg contamination is independent of the latitude over the boreal
    forest domain. This uniform contamination contrasts with that of Pb, which decreases
    towards the north over the same latitudinal span, away from the industrial centers
    of the St Lawrence Valley and the U.S. Mid-West.
