  abstract: Landscapes have been shaped by human activities for millennia and there
    is a pressing need to characterize pre-industrial impacts in order to mitigate
    present-day effects. We present the analysis of two sediment cores from Dian Lake
    in Yunnan, China, which span 4000 years. We compare cores from the northern and
    southern ends of the lake to investigate spatial variability in natural and anthropogenic
    environmental changes in this large (300 km2) lake. To document the initiation
    of human impacts on the landscape and characterize the attendant changes in the
    lake water and sediment quality, we rely on organic and inorganic geochemical
    measurements as well as sedimentology and stratigraphy. The character and magnitude
    of proxy changes are coherent between the two core sites with slight differences
    in the timing of events. At both core sites, we find definitive evidence for substantial
    anthropogenic change beginning AD 100 (1850 yr BP), coincident with the introduction
    of terraced agriculture. Sedimentological shifts are distinctive and characterized
    by an increase in magnetic susceptibility values and a visible change to red,
    fine-grained clay. The geochemistry of this sediment suggests that it was sourced
    from the eastern catchment of the lake and delivered into the basin following
    intensive agriculture and soil erosion. Anthropogenic impacts intensify after
    AD 900 through hydrologic modification and cultural eutrophication resulting from
    increased nutrient loading. This study presents evidence that human-affected landscapes
    have been present in this region of China for longer than previously believed
    and that ‘small-scale’ land use change can have measureable impacts on lakes.
