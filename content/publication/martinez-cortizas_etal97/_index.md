  abstract: The Northwestern Iberian Peninsula is a mid-latitude oceanic region with
    areas where different types of bogs are frequent or abundant. The ombrotrophic
    nature of some bogs make them suitable for the study of accumulation patterns
    of heavy metals. One of these bogs, Penido Vello, was sampled to a depth of 2.5
    m and analyzed in detail for its physico-chemical properties and Pb, Zn and Cd
    concentrations. Ash and organic carbon content, Ca/Mg molar ratios and a number
    of other characteristics support an ombrotrophic interpretation of the core. Concentrations
    of Pb, Zn and Cd were measured, showing important variations in the core. While
    Zn and Cd are concentrated mainly in the upper sections of the core with minor
    changes with depth, the Pb profile shows significant peaks in the deeper layers
    suggesting pre-industrial atmospheric pollution. Enrichment factors (EFs) calculated
    by normalising to Al correlate well with those calculated by normalising to Ti.
    Maximum EFs are 33, 56 and 52 for Pb, Zn and Cd respectively. While for Pb these
    values are comparable to those obtained by other authors, maximum Zn EFs are greater
    than those mentioned in the literature and may be attributed to the emissions
    of a nearby coal-burning power plant. At least for Pb the accumulation pattern
    suggests that atmospheric pollution can be dated back some 2800 years, and that
    pollution increased steadily since the Iron Age to reach considerably elevated
    levels, up to 5 times the ‘background’, during the Roman Empire. Changes in Pb
    emissions through time are in good accord with the prehistorical and historical
    record of the Iberian Peninsula.
