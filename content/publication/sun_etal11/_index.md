  abstract: Lead isotopes and heavy metal concentrations were measured in two sediment
    cores sampled in estuaries of Xiangjiang and Lishui Rivers in Hunan province,
    China. The presence of anthropogenic contribution was observed in both sediments,
    especially in Xiangjiang sediment. In the Xiangjiang sediment, the lower 206Pb/207Pb
    and higher 208Pb/206Pb ratio, than natural Pb isotope signature (1.198 and 2.075
    for 206Pb/207Pb and 208Pb/206Pb, respectively), indicated a significant input
    of non-indigenous Pb with low 206Pb/207Pb and high 208Pb/206Pb. The corresponding
    concentrations of heavy metals (As, Cd, Zn, Mn and Pb) were much higher than natural
    values, suggesting the contaminations of heavy metals from extensive ore-mining
    activities in the region.
