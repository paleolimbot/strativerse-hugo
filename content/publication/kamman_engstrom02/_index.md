  abstract: Lakes across the Northern Hemisphere have experienced enhanced atmospheric
    deposition of anthropogenically derived Hg for over 100 years. In the present
    study, we quantified Hg fluxes to the sediments of ten small drainage lakes across
    Vermont and New Hampshire, USA, for the period ∼1800 to present. Dates were established
    by 210Pb. Total Hg (HgT) fluxes to sediments ranged from 5 to 17μgm−2yr−1 during
    pre-industrial times, and from 21 to 83μgm−2yr−1 presently. Present-day HgT fluxes
    are between 2.1 to 6.9 times greater than pre-1850 fluxes. Current-day direct
    atmospheric Hg deposition to the study region was estimated at 21μgm−2yr−1, which
    agrees well with measured HgT deposition, when re-evasion of Hg is accounted for.
    Our data suggest that Hg fluxes to lake sediments have declined in recent decades,
    owing to reductions in atmospheric Hg deposition to the lake surface. Watershed
    export of atmospherically deposited Hg remains elevated relative to present-day
    deposition rates, which contributes to the impression that Hg retention by watershed
    soils has declined.
