  abstract: We collected a sediment core from the 6th (6J) Triglav Lake, a remote
    mountain lake in NW Slovenia, and analysed it for 25 elements, using k0-instrumental
    neutron activation analysis (k0-INAA). For Hg, we used cold vapour atomic absorption
    spectrometry (CVAAS). Data were analysed using Principal Component Analysis (PCA).
    PCA indicated several distinct groups of elements and sediment core samples. Ca
    distribution was entirely different from all other sediment components. Ba, Br,
    Hg, Sb and Zn were associated with organic matter (OM), with Hg showing the strongest
    affinity to OM. As, Cr, Fe and U formed a group of redox-sensitive elements. Two
    events that occurred ca. 1915 and in the 1940s/1950s, were identified in the core.
    They were associated with increased inputs of allochthonous material into the
    lake, and significantly affected the stratigraphic distributions of all elements.
    Some trace elements, such as As, Hg and Zn, are probably effectively retained
    in the catchment, whereas Cr tends to be readily exported from the catchment.
    Atmospheric deposition affected not only elements of anthropogenic origin (As,
    Ba, Br, Hg, Sb, Zn and Cr) that started to increase after the 1970s, but also
    those of terrestrial origin (Ca, Fe, Na). Introduction of fish into the lake in
    1991 and the subsequent increase in primary production, affected the distribution
    of Ca and elements that are redox-sensitive and/or associated with OM (As, Ba,
    Fe, Sb, U, Zn). Fe minerals in uppermost 6J sediments have a strong influence
    on the distribution of several trace elements. As and Zn closely tracked Fe, whereas
    Sb was likely released after oxidation. Climate change could also have enhanced
    inputs of elements from the catchment, but such changes were likely overwhelmed
    by the effects of increased eutrophication.
