  abstract: Although it is common knowledge that Pb concentrations have increased
    in lake sediments in the northeastern United States over the last 150 years, the
    processes responsible have been the subject of debate. In this study, differences
    in lead isotopic compositions and concentrations in sediment from large lakes
    (Lake Erie, Ontario, and Michigan) and small ones (Deep Lake and Lake Andrus)
    are used to infer temporal changes in the source(s) of anthropogenic Pb in the
    Great Lakes region. A natural (background) component of Pb is present in sediment
    deposited prior to 1860 in Lake Erie and the other lakes as indicated from low
    Pb concentrations and uniform lead isotopic compositions. Changes in isotopic
    ratios of lake sediment reflect differing sources of anthropogenic Pb superimposed
    on the natural component such as regional deforestation from 1860–1890 followed
    by coal combustion and ore smelting through 1930. Combustion of leaded gasoline
    was the dominant anthropogenic Pb source to the atmosphere (and by inference to
    lake sediment) from 1930–1980. Temporal changes in lead isotopic compositions
    in lake sediment suggest that the source of the Pb used in gasoline additives
    gradually changed from 1930 to present. The best example is a distinct shift in
    lead isotopic ratios in lake sediment deposited after 1970 which corresponds to
    increased Pb production from the Viburnum Trend deposits in Missouri (present
    in all lakes except Ontario). However, the changes in lead isotopic compositions
    are much less variable than and do not parallel those calculated on the basis
    of annual United States mine production and imports. Rather, anthropogenic recycling
    of Pb as well as natural mixing processes during emission, transport, and deposition
    of Pb in lake sediment control most of the variation in lead isotope ratios. Differences
    in lead isotopic ratios in Lake Michigan, Erie, and Deep Lake sediment preserve
    regional differences in lead isotopic ratios from U.S. and Canadian sources first
    noted in aerosols by Sturges and Barrie (1987). More localized sources of Pb (such
    as point discharges) are needed to explain the results from Lake Ontario and Andrus.
