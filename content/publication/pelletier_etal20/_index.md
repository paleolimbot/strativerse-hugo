  abstract: Wildfires release terrestrial elements to the atmosphere as aerosols,
    and these events are becoming more frequent and intense in the Arctic boreal forest
    as the climate is warming. We quantified the impact of atmospheric deposition
    of aerosols from local wildfires on metal (loid) fluxes using macroscopic charcoal
    accumulation rates, historical fire mapping and element concentrations in 210Pb-dated
    lake sediment from five subarctic lakes with small catchments. Lake sediments
    showed small but significant increases in fluxes (median = 5-10%) for 22 trace
    metals, metalloids or major ions following fire events. The impact of wildfire
    aerosols on element fluxes was mostly due to short-term (≤2 years) increasing
    sedimentation rate (6 ± 41% increase), whereas sediment element concentrations
    were not strongly impacted. Wildfire-associated deposition to lake sediments was
    mainly composed of Ca, Al, Fe, Mg, K, Mn and Na, which are major constituents
    of ash from burned biomass, but changes in sediment flux were greatest for Sb,
    As, Ni, Ba, Mn, Mo and Sr compared to pre-disturbance conditions. Compared to
    anthropogenic sources of pollution, wildfire-associated atmospheric fluxes of
    metal contaminants to the lakes (e.g., Hg, Pb, As, Sb, Cd) were low. This study
    provides quantitative estimates of wildfire impacts on atmospheric geochemical
    fluxes to subarctic lakes, which can be used for modelling larger-scale impacts
    under changing fire regimes.
