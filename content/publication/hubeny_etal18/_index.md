  abstract: Salem, MA, located north of Boston, has a rich, well-documented history
    dating back to settlement in 1626 ce, but the associated anthropogenic impacts
    on Salem Sound are poorly constrained. This project utilized dated sediment cores
    from the sound to assess the proxy record of anthropogenic alterations to the
    system and compared the proxy records to the known history. Proxies included bulk
    stable isotopes of organic matter, magnetic susceptibility, and trace metal concentrations.
    Our data reveal clear changes in organic matter composition and concentration
    associated with land use changes and twentieth century sewage disposal practices.
    Further, metal data correspond with local industrial activity, particularly the
    historic tanning industry in Peabody, MA. Although conservation practices of past
    decades have improved the state of Salem Sound, the stratigraphic record demonstrates
    that the environment is still affected by anthropogenic influences, and has not
    attained conditions consistent with pre-anthropogenic baseline. The approach and
    results of this study are applicable to coastal embayments that are being assessed
    for remediation, especially those with scant historic or monitoring data.
