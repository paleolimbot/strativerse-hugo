  abstract: Instrumental neutron activation analysis is shown to be suitable for the
    determination of arsenic in sedimentary material through satisfactory analysis
    of IAEA standard reference soil and sediment. Surface sediment from southern Loch
    Lomond contains a highly elevated arsenic concentration of 474 μg/g, in association
    with an enhanced iron content, relative to a ''base-line'' arsenic level of 18
    +- 5 μg/g. The vertical distribution of arsenic in Loch Lomond sediment is shown
    to be strongly influenced by the physical-chemical properties of the sedimentary
    column and does not preserve an unimpaired record of arsenic input to the loch.
