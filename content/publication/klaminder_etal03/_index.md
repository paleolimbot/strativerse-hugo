  abstract: Knowledge about the natural atmospheric background deposition rate of
    lead (Pb) prior to anthropogenic pollution is critical in the understanding of
    present-day pollution and for establishing realistic goals for the reduction of
    atmospheric Pb. We utilize stable Pb isotopes (206Pb and 207Pb) in radiocarbon-dated
    peat cores from three ombrotrophic bogs from south Sweden, to calculate fluxes
    and to survey atmospheric Pb trends prior 3500 BP (the so far known onset of large-scale
    anthropogenic pollution). The estimated atmospheric Pb deposition rate was between
    1 and 10 μg Pb m2 yr−1 between 5900 and 3700 calendar years BP, which is 100 to
    1000 times lower than present-day deposition rates. The majority of the samples
    older than 3500 calendar years BP had 206Pb/207Pb ratios ≤1.20, which is significantly
    lower than unpolluted Swedish mineral soils (206Pb/207Pb > 1.30), suggesting that
    even the natural atmospheric deposition of Pb was dominated by long-range transport,
    rather than local inputs from soil dust. Low 206Pb/207Pb ratios (1.16–1.18) of
    several samples indicate that this distant transport originated at least partly
    from early pollution sources. A possible climatic connection with the observed
    Pb deposition trends is suggested.
