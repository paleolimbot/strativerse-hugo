  abstract: Variation with depth and time of organic matter (carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus),
    inorganic pollutant (mercury), as well as bacterial abundance and activity, were
    investigated for the first time in sediment profiles of different parts of Lake
    Geneva (Switzerland) over the last decades. The highest organic contents (about
    32%), mercury concentration (27mgkg−1), bacterial abundance (in order of 9×109cellg−1
    dry sediment), and bacterial activity (1299 Relative Light Units (RLU)) were found
    in the highly polluted sediments contaminated by the waste water treatment plant
    (WWTP) discharge, which deposited during the period of cultural eutrophication.
    Such data, which contrast with the other sampled sites from deeper and more remote
    parts of the lake, prove that the organic matter and nutrients released from the
    municipal WWTP have considerable effects on bacterial abundance and activities
    in freshwater sediments. In fact, the relatively unpolluted deepwater sites and
    the coastal polluted site show large synchronous increases in bacterial densities
    linked to the anoxic conditions in the 1970s (lake eutrophication caused by external
    nutrient input) that subsequently increased the nutrient loading fluxes. These
    results show that the microbial activities response to natural or human-induced
    changing limnological conditions (e.g., nutrient supply, oxygen availability,
    redox conditions) constitutes a threat to the security of water resources, which
    in turn poses concerns for the world’s freshwater resources in the context of
    global warming and the degradation of water quality (oxygen depletion in the bottom
    water due to reduced deep waters mixing). Moreover, the accumulation of inorganic
    pollutants such as high mercury (methyl-mercury) concentration may represent a
    significant source of toxicity for sediment dwelling organisms.
