  abstract: 'Atmospheric deposition of large-scale lead pollution has occurred for
    at least 3000 years in Europe. Metal production and smelting were the main sources
    until the twentieth century when emissions from vehicles using alkyl-leaded petrol
    became dominant. Analyses of lake-sediment and peat deposits in Sweden and other
    regions in Europe, as well as ice cores from Greenland, suggest synchronous temporal
    changes in past pollution deposition. Characteristic features in the atmospheric
    pollution fallout were caused by: the peak in lead pro duction during the Roman
    period; the marked Mediaeval increase in mining and metal production; the rapidly
    increasing use of cars and leaded gasoline after the second world war along with
    increased industrial emissions until around 1970, which was followed by a major
    improvement due to environmental legislation. For northern Europe at least, these
    characteristic changes can be used to determine, with reasonable accuracy, at
    which levels ad 0, ad 1000–1200 and ad 1970 are situated in lake-sediment deposits.
    To identify these levels, stable lead isotope analyses (206Pb/207Pb ratios) have
    proven to be very useful besides concentration determinations. Particularly useful
    are the isotope analyses in areas, such as Sweden, where the differences in 206Pb/207Pb
    ratios are large between the natural catchment lead and the pollution lead.'
