  abstract: While the sediment records of upland lakes are known to be valuable natural
    archives of depositional changes, recent studies in the UK have shown that full
    basin records of trace metals are not showing the decline expected as a result
    of the massive reduction in emissions since the 1970s. As trends in metal deposition
    across Europe are known to be declining, this ‘additional’ trace metal input to
    upland lakes can only be the result of mobilisation from catchment storage. We
    undertook a multiple sediment core, multi-pollutant study at nine lakes across
    Scotland to test hypotheses that this additional input was a result of (i) a simple
    time-lag; (ii) catchment soil erosion; (iii) leaching with dissolved organic carbon.
    We constructed decadally resolved full basin inventories for Pb, Hg and spheroidal
    carbonaceous particles (SCPs), a particulate component of fly-ash, at lakes with
    thin soils, lakes with eroded soils and lakes with non-eroded soils in their catchments
    to assess temporal trends. The use of both trace metals and SCPs allowed a comparison
    between erosive (SCPs and metals) and leaching (metals only) processes. Our results
    showed that the full basin inventories for Hg, Pb and SCPs for lakes with thin
    catchment soils had similar temporal trends to those of atmospheric emissions
    and deposition. For lakes with significantly eroded catchment soils, increasing
    trends in inventories continued to the most recent decades while those with non-eroded
    soils showed an intermediate pattern with some similarity to atmospheric deposition
    patterns, but with a reduced recent decline. We conclude that catchment soil erosion
    is the main transfer mechanism for trace metals at these sites and that although
    the leaching of metals bound to dissolved organic carbon (DOC) may play a role
    this appears to be less significant. The processes that lead to soil erosion and
    leaching of DOC from the catchment are exacerbated by increased winter rainfall,
    prolonged summer drought and increased frequency of high intensity rain events.
    Hence, predicted climatic changes will increase pollutant transfer from catchment
    to surface waters. The catchment storage of deposited pollutants is a massive
    potential reservoir that could keep fluxes of contaminants to surface waters elevated
    for many decades to come. This would counteract the benefits of reductions in
    deposition resulting from policy implementations over recent decades and may elevate
    exposure of aquatic biota to these contaminants.
