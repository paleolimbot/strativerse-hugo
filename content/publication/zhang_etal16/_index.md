  abstract: The history records of lead and its stable isotopic ratios were determined
    in a sediment core to receive anthropogenic impacts on the Lake Hailing in eastern
    China. The sediment core was dated based on 210Pb, 137Cs, and 239+240Pu. The historical
    changes of Pb/Al and Pb isotope ratios showed increasing trend upward throughout
    the core, suggesting changes in energy usage and correlating closely with the
    experience of a rapid economic and industrial development of the catchment, Linyi
    City, in eastern China. Based on the mixing end member model of Pb isotope ratios,
    coal combustion emission dominated anthropogenic Pb sources in the half part of
    the century contributing 13 to 43 % of total Pb in sediment. Moreover, contributions
    of chemical and organic fertilizer were 1–13 and 5–14 %, respectively. In contrast,
    the contribution of leaded gasoline was low than 8 %. The results indicated that
    historical records of Pb contamination predominantly sourced from coal combustion
    and chemical and organic fertilizer in the catchment. In addition, an increase
    of coal combustion source and fertilizers was found throughout the sediment core,
    whereas the contribution of leaded gasoline had declined after 2000s, which is
    attributed to the phaseout of leaded gasoline in China.
