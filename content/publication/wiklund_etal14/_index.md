  abstract: In the Alberta oil sands region, insufficient knowledge of pre-disturbance
    reference conditions has undermined the ability of the Regional Aquatics Monitoring
    Program (RAMP) to detect pollution of the Athabasca River, because sampling began
    three decades after the industry started and the river naturally erodes oil-bearing
    strata. Here, we apply a novel approach to characterize pre-industrial reference
    metal concentrations in river sediment downstream of Alberta oil sands development
    by analyzing metal concentrations in sediments deposited in floodplain lakes of
    the Athabasca Delta during 1700–1916, when they were strongly influenced by Athabasca
    River floodwaters. We compared results to metal concentrations in surficial bottom
    sediments sampled by RAMP (2010–2013) at downstream sites of the Athabasca River
    and distributaries. When normalized to lithium content, concentrations of vanadium
    (a metal of concern in the oil sands region) and other priority pollutants (Be,
    Cd, Cr, Cu, Pb, Ni, Zn) in nearly all of the RAMP river sediment samples lie below
    the upper 95% prediction interval linearly extrapolated from the river-derived
    lake sediments. Assuming the RAMP protocols obtained recently deposited sediment,
    this indicates that the metal concentrations in downstream Athabasca River sediment
    have not increased above pre-disturbance levels. Reference conditions derived
    from the lake sediment data were used to develop profiles of metal residual concentrations
    versus time for the RAMP river sediment data, which provides an excellent tool
    for decision-makers to identify and quantify levels of metal pollution for any
    given sample, and to monitor for future trends. We recommend that the approach
    be applied to resurrect the utility of RAMP data at other river sampling locations
    closer to the development, and for ongoing risk assessment. The approach is also
    readily transferable to other rivers where insufficient pre-disturbance reference
    data impairs an ability to determine if industrial activities are polluting downstream
    ecosystems.
