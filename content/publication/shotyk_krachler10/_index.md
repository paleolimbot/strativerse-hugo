  abstract: A peat core from an ombrotrophic bog documents the isotopic evolution
    of atmospheric Pb in central Ontario since AD 1804±53 (210Pb dating). Despite
    the introduction of unleaded gasoline in the mid-1970’s, the ratio 206Pb/207Pb
    in atmospheric deposition has not increased as expected, but rather continues
    to decline. In fact, snowpack sampling (2005 and 2009) and rainwater samples (2008)
    show that the isotopic composition of atmospheric Pb today is often far less radiogenic
    than the gasoline lead that had been used in Canada in the past. The peat, snow,
    and rainwater data presented here are consistent with the Pb isotope data for
    aerosols collected in Dorset in 1984 and 1986 which were traced by Sturges and
    Barrie (1989) to emissions from the Noranda smelter in northern Quèbec, Canada’s
    largest single source of atmospheric Pb. Understanding atmospheric Pb deposition
    in central Ontario, therefore, requires not only consideration of natural sources
    and past contributions from leaded gasoline, but also emissions from metal smelting
    and refining. Lead in the streams which enter Kawagama Lake today (206Pb/207Pb=1.16−1.19)
    represents a mixture between the natural values (1.191−1.201 estimated using pre-industrial
    lake sediments) and the values found in the humus layer of the surrounding forest
    soils (206Pb/207Pb=1.15−1.19). In the lake itself, however, Pb is much less radiogenic
    (206Pb/207Pb as low as 1.09) than in the streams, with the dissolved fraction
    less radiogenic than particulate material. The evolution of Pb isotope ratios
    within the watershed apparently reflects preferential removal by sedimentation
    of comparatively dense, radiogenic, terrestrial particles (derived from the mineral
    fraction of soils) from the humus particles with lower ratios of 206Pb/207Pb (because
    of atmospheric Pb contamination). Despite the contemporary enrichments of Pb in
    rain and snow, concentrations of dissolved Pb in the lake are extremely low (sometimes
    below 10ng/l), with Pb concentrations and Pb/Sc ratios approaching “natural” values
    because of efficient binding to particles, and their subsequent removal in the
    watershed.
