  abstract: The history records of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), lead and
    its stable isotope ratios were determined in a sediment core to receive anthropogenic
    impacts on the Shilianghe Reservoir in eastern China. The historical changes of
    PAHs concentrations, PAHs fluxes, Pb/Al and Pb isotope ratios showed a synchronous
    trend throughout the core, suggesting changes in energy usage and correlating
    closely with the experience of a rapid economic and industrial development of
    the catchment, Linyi City in eastern China. PAHs isomer ratios results reveal
    PAHs in sediments are dominantly anthropogenic pyrogenic source, dominated by
    the combustion of coal and biomass. Furthermore, the Pb isotopic composition also
    clearly indicates that coal combustion dust mainly contributed to the Pb burden
    in the reservoir sediments. Based on mix end member model of Pb isotope ratios,
    coal combustion dust dominated anthropogenic Pb sources over fifty years contributing
    from 31% to 62% of total Pb in sediment. And the contribution of leaded gasoline
    was low than average 25%. In addition, a stable increase of coal combustion source
    was found in sediment core, while the contribution of leaded gasoline had declined
    in recent decades, with the phase-out of leaded gasoline in China.
