  abstract: Metallurgical activities have been undertaken in northern South America
    (NSA) for millennia. However, it is still unknown how far atmospheric emissions
    from these activities have been transported. Since the timing of metallurgical
    activities is currently estimated from scarce archaeological discoveries, the
    availability of reliable and continuous records to refine the timing of past metal
    deposition in South America is essential, as it provides an alternative to discontinuous
    archives, as well as evidence for global trace metal transport. We show in a peat
    record from Tierra del Fuego that anthropogenic metals likely have been emitted
    into the atmosphere and transported from NSA to southern South America (SSA) over
    the last 4200 yrs. These findings are supported by modern time back-trajectories
    from NSA to SSA. We further show that apparent anthropogenic Cu and Sb emissions
    predate any archaeological evidence for metallurgical activities. Lead and Sn
    were also emitted into the atmosphere as by-products of Inca and Spanish metallurgy,
    whereas local coal-gold rushes and the industrial revolution contributed to local
    contamination. We suggest that the onset of pre-Hispanic metallurgical activities
    is earlier than previously reported from archaeological records and that atmospheric
    emissions of metals were transported from NSA to SSA.
