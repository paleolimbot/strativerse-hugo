  abstract: The ratio of Pb concentrations (μg g−1) to excess 210Pb (210Pbexc) activities
    (dpm g−1) in the surface (0–1 cm) sediments of lake cores, together with a knowledge
    of atmospheric 210Pb fluxes, were used to estimate the atmospheric deposition
    of stable Pb in south-central Ontario, Canada. Between three and five cores were
    collected from each of 10 lakes, while in one lake (Red Chalk - Main Basin) a
    total of 25 cores were obtained. The average atmospheric 210Pbexc flux to the
    main basin of Red Chalk Lake was calculated to be 1.1 dpm cm−2 year−1, a value
    which compares favourably with literature estimates of 210Pb deposition for Ontario.
    The surface Pb/210Pbexc ratios for 61 cores ranged between 1.26 and 3.44 μg dpm−1(average
    2.15 ± 0.45 μg dpm−1). Therefore, the predicted atmospheric Pb deposition was
    14–38 mg m−2 year−1 (average 24 ± 5.0 mg m−2 year−1). This estimate of stable
    Pb fallout is similar to those measured by alternate methods and indicates that
    elemental ratios in lake sediments might be useful for predicting the behaviour
    of other contaminants in lakes.
