  abstract: Geochemical measurements on well-dated sediment cores from Lake Er (Erhai)
    are used to determine the timing of changes in metal concentrations over 4500
    years in Yunnan, a borderland region in southwestern China noted for rich mineral
    deposits but with inadequately documented metallurgical history. Our findings
    add new insight into the impacts and environmental legacy of human exploitation
    of metal resources in Yunnan history. We observe an increase in copper at 1500
    BC resulting from atmospheric emissions associated with metallurgy. These data
    clarify the chronological issues related to links between the onset of Yunnan
    metallurgy and the advent of bronze technology in adjacent Southeast Asia, subjects
    that have been debated for nearly half a century. We also observe an increase
    from 1100 to 1300 AD in a number of heavy metals including lead, silver, zinc,
    and cadmium from atmospheric emissions associated with silver smelting. Culminating
    during the rule of the Mongols, known as the Yuan Dynasty (1271â€“1368 AD), these
    metal concentrations approach levels three to four times higher than those from
    industrialized mining activity occurring within the catchment today. Notably,
    the concentrations of lead approach levels at which harmful effects may be observed
    in aquatic organisms. The persistence of this lead pollution over time created
    an environmental legacy that likely contributes to known issues in modern day
    sediment quality. We demonstrate that historic metallurgical production in Yunnan
    can cause substantial impacts on the sediment quality of lake systems, similar
    to other paleolimnological findings around the globe.
