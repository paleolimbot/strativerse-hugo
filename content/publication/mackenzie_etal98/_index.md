  abstract: The use of concentration profiles of lead and other contaminant metals
    in 210Pb-dated ombrotrophic peat cores for reconstruction of historical trends
    in atmospheric deposition has become relatively well established. However, uncertainty
    remains over the validity of the assumption of post-depositional immobility of
    lead in peats. In particular, a number of studies have suggested that in saturated
    peat systems, lead is subject to diagenetic remobilisation and redistribution,
    with the result that 210Pb and lead profiles do not provide a historical record
    of deposition. Results are presented here for lead concentrations, inventories
    and stable isotope ratios and for 210Pb activities in two peat cores from locations
    close to the Glasgow industrial area in west-central Scotland. Contrasting biogeochemical
    conditions prevailed at the two sampling sites, with one being unsaturated and
    ombrotrophic while the other was saturated and minerotrophic. The results for
    the ombrotrophic peat core were compatible with information from other peat and
    lake sediment core studies, data for archived herbage samples and with known historical
    trends both in industrial activity and in the use of lead as an additive to petrol,
    giving a high degree of confidence in the 210Pb chronology and implied record
    of deposition. This provides strong support for the suggestion that lead is immobile
    in such systems. In contrast, the lead concentration profile and stable isotope
    data for the minerotrophic peat provided apparent temporal variations that were
    inconsistent with other studies and known historical trends, confirming that the
    saturated peat core did not provide a record of atmospheric deposition. This observation
    is consistent with the suggestion that lead is subject to diagenetic remobilisation
    and redistribution in saturated peats.
