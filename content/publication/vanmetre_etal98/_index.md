  abstract: Although it is well-known that concentrations of anthropogenic radionuclides
    and organochlorine compounds in aquatic systems have decreased since their widespread
    release has stopped in the United States, the magnitude and variability of rates
    of decrease are not well-known. Paleolimnological studies of reservoirs provide
    a tool for evaluating these long-term trends in riverine systems. Rates of decrease
    from the 1960s to the 1990s of 137Cs, PCBs, and total DDT in dated sediment cores
    from 11 reservoirs in the eastern and central United States were modeled using
    first-order rate models. Mean half-times of 10.0 (±2.5), 9.5 (±2.2), and 13 (±5.8)
    yr for decay-corrected 137Cs, PCBs, and total DDT, respectively, are surprisingly
    similar. Similar rates of decrease in a few reservoirs are also demonstrated for
    chlordane and lead. Conceptual and simple mathematical models relating two soil
    distributions of 137Cs to trends in the cores provide insight into differences
    in trends between watersheds with different land uses and suggest that trends
    are controlled by erosion, transport, mixing, and deposition of sediments. These
    results, supported by similar trends reported for other settings and environmental
    media, could provide an estimate of the decadal response time of riverine systems
    to changes in the regulation of other persistent hydrophobic or particle-reactive
    contaminants.
