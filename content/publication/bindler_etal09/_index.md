  abstract: Metal pollution is viewed as a modern problem that began in the 19th century
    and accelerated through the 20th century; however, in many parts of the globe
    this view is wrong. Here, we studied past waterborne metal pollution in lake sediments
    from the Bergslagen region in central Sweden, one of many historically important
    mining regions in Europe. With a focus on lead (including isotopes), we trace
    mining impacts from a local scale, through a 120-km-long river system draining
    into Mälaren – Sweden's third largest lake, and finally also the Baltic Sea. Comparison
    of sediment and peat records shows that pollution from Swedish mining was largely
    waterborne and that atmospheric deposition was dominated by long-range transport
    from other regions. Swedish ore lead is detectable from the 10th century, but
    the greatest impact occurred during the 16th–18th centuries with improvements
    occurring over recent centuries, i.e., historical pollution>modern industrial
    pollution.
