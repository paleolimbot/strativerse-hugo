  abstract: "Organcochlorine compounds, semivolatile-organic compounds (SVOC), and
    trace elements were analyzed in reservoir sediment cores, streambed sediment,
    and fish tissue in the Santa Ana River Basin as part of the U.S. Geological Survey's
    National Water-Quality Assessment Program. Three reservoirs were sampled in areas
    that have different degrees of urbanization. Streambed sediment and fish tissue
    collected at 12 sites were divided into two groups, urban and nonurban. More organochlorine
    compounds were detected in reservoir sediment cores, streambed sediment and fish
    tissue, and at higher concentrations at urban sites than at nonurban sites. At
    all sites, except West Street Basin, concentrations of organochlorine compounds
    were lower than the probable-effect concentration (PEC). At the highly urbanized
    West Street Basin, chlordane and p,pÂ´-DDE exceeded the PEC throughout the historical
    record. The less stringent threshold-effect concentration (TEC) was exceeded for
    six compounds at eight sites. Most of the organochlorine compounds detected in
    streambed sediment and fish tissue were at urban sites on the Santa Ana River
    as opposed to its tributaries, suggesting accumulation and persistence in the
    river.\r\n\r\n\r\nMore SVOCs were detected in reservoir sediment cores and streambed
    sediment, and at higher concentrations, at urban sites than at nonurban sites.
    At all the sites, except West Street Basin, concentrations of SVOCs were lower
    than the PEC. At West Street Basin, chrysene, pyrene, and total polycyclic-aromatic
    hydrocarbons exceeded the PEC throughout the historical record. The TEC was exceeded
    for 10 compounds at 3 sites. Most of the SVOCs were detected in streambed sediment
    at urban sites on tributaries to the Santa Ana River rather than the mainstem
    itself. The less frequent occurrence and lower concentrations in the Santa Ana
    River suggest that SVOCs are less persistent than organochlorine compounds, possibly
    as a result of volatization, gradation, or dilution.\r\n\r\n\r\nMost trace-element
    detections in reservoir sediment cores and streambed sediment were at urban sites,
    and the concentrations were generally higher than at nonurban sites. Lead and
    zinc exceeded their PECs at West Street Basin throughout the historical record;
    copper exceeded its PEC at Canyon Lake, an area of urban growth. The TEC was exceeded
    for 10 compounds at 11 sites. Frequency of detection and concentration did not
    differ between tributary and Santa Ana River sites, which may be attributed to
    the fact that trace elements occur naturally. Four trace elements (arsenic, copper,
    mercury, and selenium) had higher concentrations in fish tissue at nonurban sites
    than at urban sites.\r\n\r\n\r\nConcentrations decreased over time for organochlorine
    compounds at all three reservoirs, probably a result of the discontinued use of
    many of the compounds. Decreasing trends in SVOCs and trace elements were observed
    at West Street Basin, but increasing trends were observed at Canyon Lake. Concentrations
    of organochlorine compounds, SVOCs, and trace elements were higher during periods
    of above average rainfall at both West Street Basin and Canyon Lake."
