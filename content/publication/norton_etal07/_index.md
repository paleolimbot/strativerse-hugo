  abstract: Lake sediment cores, dated by 210Pb, were collected from Spectacle Pond
    (SP), Massachusetts, and Side Pistol Lake (SPL) and Sargent Mountain Pond (SMP),
    Maine, USA. SP is a kettle seepage lake in granitic sand and gravel. SMP is a
    drainage pond on granite with little soil in the small watershed. SPL is a drainage
    lake in granitic till. The three cores were analyzed for total Cd. For SP and
    SMP, maximum concentrations of 1.7 and 3.9mg/kg, four and eight times background
    concentrations, respectively, occur in the late 1960s. Accumulation rates reach
    maximum values concurrently with concentration and are 0.054 and 0.016μg/cm2/a,
    more than 10 times background. Concentration and accumulation rate age relationships
    in SMP and SP are similar for background values, timing and magnitude of increase
    to peak values, and the decrease nearly to background values since about 1975.
    The chemical response to decreased atmospheric deposition lags in SPL sediment.
    Kettle-like lakes more clearly indicate changes in atmospheric deposition than
    drainage lakes.
