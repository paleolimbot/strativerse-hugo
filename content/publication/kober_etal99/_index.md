  abstract: 'Pb isotope ratios and Pb concentrations of well-dated sediments of Lake
    Constance, Central Europe have been analyzed using thermal ion mass spectrometry.
    Sequential extraction studies indicated isotope homogeneity of the leachable Pb
    components within the investigated layers. Since the middle of the 19th century
    a significant anthropogenic Pb component appeared in the lake sediments, and rapidly
    approached concentration levels similar to that of the geogenic Pb background
    (20 ppm) at the beginning of the 20th century. Anthropogenic Pb was predominantly
    transferred to the lake sediments via the atmosphere. Pb sources were coal combustion,
    industrial ore processing and leaded gasoline. The flux of a fluvial Pb component
    to the lake sediments, additive to atmospheric Pb deposition, peaked in about
    1960. This flux is attributed to (re)mobilization of Pb from polluted parts of
    the lake catchment, and indicates the change of catchment soils from a pollution
    sink to a heavy metal source. The strong reduction of anthropogenic Pb in the
    uppermost lake sediments since the 1960’s has been caused by advances of environmental
    protection. The lake sediments record the changing fluxes and the isotope composition
    of the deposited aeolian Pb pollution. During the 20th century aeolian Pb fluxes
    to the lake sediments were in the range of 1–4 μg/cm2/a. During peak emission
    periods of gasoline Pb to the atmosphere (1960–1990) the aerosol Pb isotope composition
    was rather constant (206Pb/207Pb: 1.12–1.13) and probably a mixture of Canadian
    and Australian with Russian and Central European Pb types. Aeolian Pb isotope
    and Pb flux trends in the lake sediments as a whole agree well with the trends
    found in Alpine glaciers Doring et al 1997a, Doring et al 1997b and in ombrotrophic
    peat bogs of Switzerland (Shotyk et al., 1996). However, different industrial
    Pb components were deposited in the archives of aeolian pollution during the early
    20th century.'
