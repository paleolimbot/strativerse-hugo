  abstract: A sediment core from the southern basin of freshwater Loch Lomond, Scotland,
    was thinly sectioned at 3mm intervals and analysed for radiocaesium, present as
    a result of fallout from the atmospheric nuclear weapons’ testing programme of
    the 1950s and 1960s and from the Chernobyl reactor accident of April 1986. The
    high-resolution sampling enabled much improved resolution of peaks from weapons
    testing fallout and Chernobyl and led to the estimation of a sedimentation rate
    (30·9mgcm-2y-1) for which the uncertainty was a factor of five times less than
    that of a previous study based on a 1cm sampling frequency. Further potential
    advantages of high-resolution sampling in distinguishing possible influences upon
    the vertical distribution of radiocaesium in sediments are discussed.
