  abstract: Profiles of porewater pH and dissolved As, Fe, Mn, sulfate, total sulfide
    (ΣS−II), total zero-valent sulfur (ΣS0), organic carbon and major ion concentrations,
    as well as those of solid As, acid-volatile sulfide (AVS), total S, Fe, Mn, Al,
    organic C, 210Pb and 137Cs were determined in the sediment of four lakes spanning
    a range of redox and geochemical conditions. An inverse modeling approach, based
    on a one-dimensional transport-reaction equation assuming steady-state, was applied
    to the porewater As profiles and used to constrain the net rates of reactions
    involving As (RnetAs). The model defines depth intervals where As is either released
    to (positive RnetAs) or removed from (negative RnetAs) the porewaters. At two
    of the sites, whose bottom water were oxygenated at sampling time, a production
    zone (RnetAs=12×10−18molcm−3s−1–71×10−18molcm−3s−1) is inferred a few cm below
    the sediment–water interface, coincident with sharp porewater As and Fe peaks
    that indicate an intense coupled recycling of As and Fe. This process is confirmed
    by solid As and Fe maxima just below the sediment surface. In these two lakes
    a zone of As consumption (RnetAs=−5×10−18molcm−3s−1 to −53×10−18molcm−3s−1), attributed
    to the slow adsorption of As to authigenic Fe oxyhydroxides, occurs just above
    the production zone. A second-order rate constant kadsAs of 0.12±0.03cm3mol−1s−1
    is estimated for this adsorption reaction. Such features in the porewater and
    solid profiles were absent from the two other lakes that develop a seasonally
    anoxic hypolimnion. Thermodynamic calculations indicate that the porewaters of
    the four lakes, when sulfidic (i.e., ΣS−II⩾0.1μM), were undersaturated with respect
    to all known solid As sulfides; the calculation also predicts the presence of
    AsV oxythioanions in the sulfidic waters, as suggested by a recent study. In the
    sulfidic waters, the removal of As (RnetAs=−1×10−18molcm−3s−1 to −23×10−18molcm−3s−1)
    consistently occurred when saturation, with respect to FeS(s), was reached and
    when AsV oxythioanions were predicted to be significant components of total dissolved
    As. This finding has potential implications for As transport in other anoxic waters
    and should be tested in a wider variety of natural environments.
