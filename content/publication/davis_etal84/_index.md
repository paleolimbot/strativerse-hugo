  abstract: Deep-water sediment cores from 32 Scandinavian and 19 northern New England,
    U.S.A., lakes were analyzed for 137Cs; 210Pb was analyzed in cores from 16 and
    14 of these lakes, respectively. Additional dating of the New England cores was
    based on chronostratigraphic pollen markers. The profiles in sediment of 137Cs
    deviate greatly from expectations based on fallout history. The profiles have
    their maxima at the surface, and 137Cs occurs at depths dated by 210Pb and pollen
    as many decades older than the beginning of 137Cs fallout. Non-exponential 210Pb
    profiles in certain lakes (most in New England) and pollen dates suggest that
    bioturbation, physical mixing, changes in sedimentation rate, or acidification
    may be occurring, but this is insufficient to account for the deviant 137Cs profiles.
    In most of the lakes there is no evidence of mixing. We argue that the occurrence
    of 137Cs at prefallout sediment depths is due mostly to net downward molecular
    diffusion and adsorption, and that surface concentration is due to net upward
    diffusion and adsorption (and possibly also biological uptake), recycling of sedimentary
    137Cs in the water column, and delayed input from the watershed. It is probable
    that much of the 137Cs entering these lakes is carried by organic detritus. Mobility
    of 137Cs in this sediment may be a function of release by organic decomposition
    and scarcity of clay minerals for adsorption. Correlation analyses of the sedimentary
    radionuclide activities vs. physical and chemical characteristics of the lake
    water, sediment and watersheds suggest that considerable trapping of 137Cs and
    210Pb by terrestrial vegetation and organic soils is occurring. The resultant
    delayed export to these lakes is contributing to the failure of 137Cs as a dating
    tool, but 210Pb dating can be valid under these circumstances.
