  abstract: Analyses of sediment cores from Jellybean Lake, a small, evaporation-insensitive
    groundwater-fed lake, provide a record of changes in North Pacific atmospheric
    circulation for the last ∽7500 yr at 5- to 30-yr resolution. Isotope hydrology
    data from the southern Yukon indicate that the oxygen isotope composition of water
    from Jellybean Lake reflects the composition of mean-annual precipitation, δ18Op.
    Recent changes in the δ18O of Jellybean sedimentary calcite (δ18Oca) correspond
    to changes in the North Pacific Index (NPI), a measure of the intensity and position
    of the Aleutian Low (AL) pressure system. This suggests that δ18Op variability
    was related to the degree of fractionation during moisture transport from the
    Gulf of Alaska across the St. Elias Mountains and that Holocene shifts were controlled
    by the intensity and position of the AL. Following this model, between ∽7500 and
    4500 cal yr B.P., long-term trends suggest a predominantly weaker and/or westward
    AL. Between ∽4500 and 3000 cal yr B.P. the AL shifted eastward or intensified
    before shifting westward or weakening between ∽3000 and 2000 cal yr B.P. Rapid
    shifts eastward and/or intensification occurred ∽1200 and 300 cal yr B.P. Holocene
    changes in North Pacific atmospheric circulation inferred from Jellybean Lake
    oxygen isotopes correspond with late Holocene glacial advances in the St. Elias
    Mountains, changes in North Pacific salmon abundance, and shifts in atmospheric
    circulation over the Beaufort Sea.
