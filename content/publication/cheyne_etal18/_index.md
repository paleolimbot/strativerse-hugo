  abstract: The utility of lead (Pb) isotopes as tracers of particulate contamination
    and as chronostratigraphic markers was assessed in five lake sediment cores from
    the Great Lakes and southern Ontario region. The marker for smelting of highly
    radiogenic ores in the Upper Mississippi Valley in the mid-19th century was seen
    in the Pb isotopes in four lakes expanding the geographic range of this established
    marker into southern and central Ontario. This marker is useful for age-dating
    sediments deposited in the 1800s in archives where it is present. The estimated
    dates for this ~1850 marker using other dating methods span a range of 57years,
    emphasizing the importance of the marker as a tie-point for extrapolated dates
    in the 19th century. Lead isotopes identified leaded gasoline as an important
    source only in one lake in the second half of the 20th century; its signal was
    not identified in all other lakes because the lakes were more affected by local
    and regional inputs. Lead isotopes combined with trace metal fluxes identified
    a potential marker for coal combustion or urban sources in the second half of
    the 20th century in southern Ontario, where these sources were significant enough
    to outweigh leaded gasoline input. The effects of Canadian mining and smelting
    activities were seen in the trace metal flux profiles of central Ontario lakes;
    however, these activities were not visible in the Pb isotopes, likely due to mixing
    of several sources with similar Pb isotopic signatures. This study demonstrates
    the usefulness of combining lead isotopes and trace metal flux profiles for identifying
    markers of historical and modern particulate contamination sources, especially
    in regions where several pollution sources exist.
