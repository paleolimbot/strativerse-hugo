  abstract: Small, recreationally important lakes are economically critical to communities
    across Canada. Using a 210Pb and 14C dated sediment core from Alta Lake, Whistler,
    British Columbia, long-term changes in water quality were reconstructed using
    C/N stable isotopes, metals, and historical records. Evidence was found for a
    large-scale influx of terrestrial carbon at 1563±98 AD and channel avulsion on
    the 21-Mile Creek alluvial fan at 1754±81 AD. Changes in stable isotopes beginning
    at 1949±17 AD indicated increased productivity in response to nutrient loading
    from septic-derived nutrients. Increased metal deposition (Cu, As, and Zn) during
    the same period indicates that watershed disturbance during the construction of
    the highway was likely a significant contributor of metals to Alta Lake. Previous
    limnological assessments of Alta Lake concluded that Alta Lake is an oligotrophic,
    clear-water lake with excellent water quality. This study confirmed these data
    but indicated that nutrient loading and increased productivity in Alta Lake continue
    to occur. The application of the paleolimnological method to the assessment of
    Alta Lake confirmed that the suite of abiotic proxies used was effective in characterizing
    long-term trends in water quality, and that a long-term perspective on water quality
    variability is necessary to develop effective management practices for Alta Lake
    and other small, economically important lakes across Canada.
