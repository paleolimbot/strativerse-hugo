  abstract: Reservoir sediments are rarely used as environmental archives because
    of the potential for sediment disturbance by fluctuating water levels. However,
    rapid rates of sedimentation, proximity to urban centres and often the existence
    of management records, may make them potentially important resources for reconstructing
    recent, anthropogenically-derived environmental change. This project assesses
    the potential of reservoir sedimentary records for reconstructing past atmospheric
    and drainage basin fluxes of heavy metals (manganese, iron, nickel, copper, zinc
    and lead) in the southern Pennines, UK. Five reservoirs were selected on the basis
    of management history and drainage basin characteristics. Multi-parameter analysis
    showed sediments to be replicable across the ȁ8accumulating zone’ with reasonably
    consistent rates of sedimentation. Water level fluctuations were not found to
    detrimentally affect sediment records in the deepwater area of the reservoirs.
    In fact, spheroidal carbonaceous particle (SCP) profiles show trends in inputs
    that closely reflect major changes in industrialisation, indicating the reservoir
    sediments to be excellent records of particulate inputs. Only lead (Pb) and zinc
    (Zn) were significantly enriched in the reservoir sediment in comparison to background
    levels. Manganese (Mn), iron (Fe) and to a limited degree, copper (Cu), appeared
    to be affected by post-deposition mobility. Preliminary calculations of Pb fluxes
    indicate that over 80% of the current Pb input to the reservoirs is from Pb deposited
    onto drainage basin soils in the past, rather than from direct atmospheric deposition
    or natural background inputs. In Howden reservoir, for example, the total Pb flux
    to deepwater sediment cores in 2000 was 119 mg m−2 a−1. Of this, an estimated
    99 mg m−2 a−1 was from anthropogenically-derived Pb, initially deposited onto
    drainage basin soils and subsequently entering the reservoir via erosion and leaching
    processes. There is, therefore, no indication that the flux of Pb to the aquatic
    system is declining in response to reductions in Pb deposition. The ecotoxicological
    effects of the high and continuing Pb flux to these reservoirs, despite recent
    decreases in atmospheric deposition, is an area requiring further investigation.
