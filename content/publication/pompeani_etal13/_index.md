  abstract: The mining and use of copper by prehistoric people on Michigan’s Keweenaw
    Peninsula is one of the oldest examples of metalworking. We analyzed the concentration
    of lead, titanium, magnesium, iron, and organic matter in sediment cores recovered
    from three lakes located near mine pits to investigate the timing, location, and
    magnitude of ancient copper mining pollution. Lead concentrations were normalized
    to lithogenic metals and organic matter to account for processes that can influence
    natural (or background) lead delivery. Nearly simultaneous lead enrichments occurred
    at Lake Manganese and Copper Falls Lake ∼8000 and 7000 years before present (yr
    BP), indicating that copper extraction occurred concurrently in at least two locations
    on the peninsula. The poor temporal coherence among the lead enrichments from
    ∼6300 to 5000 yr BP at each lake suggests that the focus of copper mining and
    annealing shifted through time. In sediment younger than ∼5000 yr BP, lead concentrations
    remain at background levels at all three lakes, excluding historic lead increases
    starting ∼150 yr BP. Our work demonstrates that lead emissions associated with
    both the historic and Old Copper Complex tradition are detectable and can be used
    to determine the temporal and geographic pattern of metal pollution.
