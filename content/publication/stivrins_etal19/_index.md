  abstract: Anthropogenic impacts on lake ecosystems have increased substantially
    towards the present. However, the strength and timing in most cases are not evaluated
    in detail, missing valuable information on the response and recovery of an aquatic
    system. In this study, we use the sediment total organic carbon/total nitrogen
    ratio (C/N) and inductively coupled-optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES) elements
    and the available information about the biological processes to explore anthropogenic
    land use impact on the lake ecosystem. As a case study we selected a hemiboreal
    lake Trikātas (Latvia, NE Europe). The Pearson correlation was used to statistically
    test the correlations of all variables. Our results show that the C/N ratio lowered
    immediately with the onset of crop cultivation at 500 BCE. Extensive forest clearance
    and an abrupt increase in land use are reflected through the associated chemical
    elements from ICP-OES and the increasing presence of herbivore dung spores since
    1200 CE. These changes concur with the excess of fish remains suggesting a decrease
    in fish populations. Interestingly, anthropogenic land use driven erosion and
    accompanied calcium carbonate (CaCO3) matter influx favoured the abundance of
    Chara spp. in Lake Trikātas since 500 CE, which currently forms the protected
    specific habitat-type (H3140) of the European Union. At present, specific submerged
    macrophyte Chara habitat-type diminished almost entirely due to increased nutrient
    input, phytoplankton blooming, hypertrophic conditions and reduced light availability.
    The continued land use practices led to a switch in organic matter source in the
    lake from macrophytes to solely algal origin. The current study underlines the
    need of additional methods used to detect the sensitivity of lake ecosystem to
    external disturbances such as minor anthropogenic land use that might not necessarily
    be apparent in more traditional analyses such as palynology.
