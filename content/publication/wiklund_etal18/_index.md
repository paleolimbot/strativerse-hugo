  abstract: High tech applications, primarily photovoltaics, have greatly increased
    demand for the rare and versatile but toxic element tellurium (Te). Here we examine
    dated lake sediment Te concentration profiles collected near potential point sources
    (metal smelters, coal mining/combustion facilities, oil sands operations) and
    from rural regions and remote natural areas of Canada. Te contamination was most
    prevalent near a Cu/Zn smelter where observed deposition infers 21 g Te released
    per metric ton (t) of Cu processed. Globally, 9,500 t is predicted to have been
    atmospherically deposited near Cu smelters post-1900. In a remote area of central
    Canada (Experimental Lakes Area; ELA), preindustrial Te deposition rates were
    equivalent to the estimated average global mass flux supplied from natural sources;
    however more surprisingly, modern Te deposition rates were 6-fold higher and comparable
    with Te measurements in precipitation. We therefore suggest that sediment cores
    reliably record atmospheric Te deposition and that anthropogenic activities have
    significantly augmented atmospheric Te levels, making it an emerging contaminant
    of potential concern. Lake water residence time was found to influence lake sediment
    Te inventories among lakes within a region. The apparent settling rate for Te
    was comparable to macronutrients (C, N, P), likely indicative of significant biological
    processing of Te.
