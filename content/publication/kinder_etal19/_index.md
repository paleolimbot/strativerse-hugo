  abstract: Annually laminated lake sediments provide high-resolution and accurate
    timescales for reliable paleoenvironmental reconstructions. We investigated human
    activity in a low-human-impact region of Poland, taking advantage of varved sediments
    from Lake Szurpiły, which span the last 8200 years. Multiple sediment variables
    indicated that catchment evolution and lacustrine responses, mainly to changes
    in forest cover, were divided into four phases. Because of sparse or only seasonal
    occupation of settlements in NE Poland, human impact in the region was insignificant
    until ca. 939 ± 55 BC (lacustrine phase I). During Phase II (939 ± 55 BC–AD 1392
    ± 38), we recorded an increase in human indicators, reflecting the direct influence
    of a Yatvingian community. Afterwards, between AD 1392 ± 38 and 1770 ± 30 (phase
    III), permanent settlements and agricultural land use stabilized. The beginning
    of the last period (phase IV) was clearly identified by all sediment variables,
    which responded simultaneously to local human activities. Disappearance of laminae
    from AD 1858 ± 22 until about AD 1997 indicated disturbance of pre-existing, stable
    depositional conditions, followed by environmental recovery in the last 20 years.
    Such recovery may have been related to recent socio-economic changes and establishment
    of a park that reduced human influence on the lake.
