  abstract: Terrigenous (Sc, Fe, K, Mg, Al, Ti) and anthropogenic (Pb and Cu) element
    fluxes were measured in a new sediment core from Lake Biel (Switzerland) and in
    previously well-documented cores from two upstream lakes (Lake Brienz and Lake
    Thun). These three large peri-alpine lakes are connected by the Aare River, which
    is the main tributary to the High Rhine River. Major and trace element analysis
    of the sediment cores by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS)
    shows that the site of Lake Brienz receives three times more terrigenous elements
    than the two other studied sites, given by the role of Lake Brienz as the first
    major sediment sink located in the foothills of the Alps. Overall, the terrigenous
    fluxes reconstructed at the three studied sites suggest that the construction
    of sediment-trapping reservoirs during the twentieth century noticeably decreased
    the riverine suspended sediment load at a regional scale. In fact, the extensive
    river damming that occurred in the upstream watershed catchment (between ca. 1930
    and 1950 and up to 2,300 m a.s.l.) and that significantly modified seasonal suspended
    sediment loads and riverine water discharge patterns to downstream lakes noticeably
    diminished the long-range transport of (fine) terrigenous particles by the Aare
    River. Concerning the transport of anthropogenic pollutants, the lowest lead enrichment
    factors (EFs Pb) were measured in the upstream course of the Aare River at the
    site of Lake Brienz, whereas the metal pollution was highest in downstream Lake
    Biel, with the maximum values measured between 1940 and 1970 (EF Pb > 3). The
    following recorded regional reduction in aquatic Pb pollution started about 15
    years before the actual introduction of unleaded gasoline in 1985. Furthermore,
    the radiometric dating of the sediment core from Lake Biel identifies three events
    of hydrological transport of artificial radionuclides released by the nuclear
    reactor of Mühleberg located at more than 15 km upstream of Lake Biel for the
    time period 1970–2000.
