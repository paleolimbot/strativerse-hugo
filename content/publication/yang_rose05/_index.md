  abstract: Sediment cores were taken from six sites across the UK. Apart from Banbury
    Reservoir in London, all the other sites are relatively remote lakes. Trace elements
    Pb, Zn, Cu, Cd, Cr, Ni, Sn, As and V, major elements such as Fe, Mn, Ti and Al
    were analysed, and organic content measured as loss-on-ignition was determined
    in all of these cores. The result shows that these relatively remote sites have
    experienced enhanced atmospheric deposition of anthropogenically derived trace
    elements for over 100 years, and the contamination might start before industrialisation.
    Trace metal contamination remains the highest level at Banbury Reservoir showing
    “pollution source” influence. Despite the considerable reduction in atmospheric
    deposition in recent years, although some of the element concentrations in the
    surface sediments have declined, they are still much higher than their natural
    background values. In these sites, trace element pollution records have been influenced
    by many different factors. Redox condition could affect As distribution in the
    sediments. Sediment matrix could also affect trace element pollution signal. Apart
    from direct atmospheric deposition, the distributions of trace elements in the
    sediments have been affected by forestry activities and catchment erosion, and
    more contaminated soil in-wash could increase sediment pollution whilst less contaminated
    soil could dilute sediment pollution. In some sites, data suggest that catchment
    in-wash is an important source of elements for the lakes.
