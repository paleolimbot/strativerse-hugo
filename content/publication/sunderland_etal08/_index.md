  abstract: Changes in atmospheric mercury deposition are used to evaluate the effectiveness
    of regulations controlling emissions. This analysis can be complicated by seemingly
    incongruent data from different model runs, model types, and field measurements.
    Here we present a case study example that describes how to identify trends in
    regional scale mercury deposition using best-available information from multiple
    data sources. To do this, we use data from three atmospheric chemistry models
    (CMAQ, GEOS-Chem, HYSPLIT) and multiple sediment archives (ombrotrophic bog, headwater
    lake, coastal salt marsh) from the Bay of Fundy region in Canada. Combined sediment
    and modeling data indicate that deposition attributable to US and Canadian emissions
    has declined in recent years, thereby increasing the relative significance of
    global sources. We estimate that anthropogenic emissions in the US and Canada
    account for 28–33% of contemporary atmospheric deposition in this region, with
    the rest from natural (14–32%) and global sources (41–53%).
