  abstract: We investigate the distributions of several key diagenetic reactants (C,
    S, Fe) and redox-sensitive trace metals (Mo, Cd, Re, U) in sediments from Lake
    Tanganyika, East Africa. This study includes modern sediments from a chemocline
    transect, which spans oxygenated shallow waters to sulfidic conditions at depth,
    as well as ancient sediments from a longer core (∼2m) taken at ∼900m water depth.
    Modern sediments from depths spanning ∼70–335m are generally characterized by
    increasing enrichments of C, S, Mo, Cd, and U with increasing water depth but
    static Fe distributions. It appears that the sedimentary enrichments of these
    elements are, to varying degrees, influenced by a combination of organic carbon
    cycling and sulfur cycling. These modern lake characteristics contrast with a
    period of high total organic carbon (Corg), total sulfur (STot), and trace metal
    concentrations observed in the 900m core, a period which follows the most recent
    deglaciation (∼18–11ky). This interval is followed abruptly by an interval (∼11–6ky)
    that is characterized by lower C, S, U, and Mo. Consistent with other work we
    suspect that the low concentrations of S, Mo, and U may indicate a period of intense
    lake mixing, during which time the lake may have been less productive and less
    reducing as compared to the present. An alternative, but not mutually exclusive,
    hypothesis is that changes in the lake’s chemical inventory, driven by significant
    hydrological changes, could be influencing the distribution of sedimentary trace
    elements through time.
