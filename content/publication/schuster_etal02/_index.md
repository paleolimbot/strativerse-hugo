  abstract: Mercury (Hg) contamination of aquatic ecosystems and subsequent methylmercury
    bioaccumulation are significant environmental problems of global extent. At regional
    to global scales, the primary mechanism of Hg contamination is atmospheric Hg
    transport. Thus, a better understanding of the long-term history of atmospheric
    Hg cycling and quantification of the sources is critical for assessing the regional
    and global impact of anthropogenic Hg emissions. Ice cores collected from the
    Upper Fremont Glacier (UFG), Wyoming, contain a high-resolution record of total
    atmospheric Hg deposition (ca. 1720−1993). Total Hg in 97 ice-core samples was
    determined with trace-metal clean handling methods and low-level analytical procedures
    to reconstruct the first and most comprehensive atmospheric Hg deposition record
    of its kind yet available from North America. The record indicates major atmospheric
    releases of both natural and anthropogenic Hg from regional and global sources.
    Integrated over the past 270-year ice-core history, anthropogenic inputs contributed
    52%, volcanic events 6%, and background sources 42%. More significantly, during
    the last 100 years, anthropogenic sources contributed 70% of the total Hg input.
    Unlike the 2−7-fold increase observed from preindustrial times (before 1840) to
    the mid-1980s in sediment-core records, the UFG record indicates a 20-fold increase
    for the same period. The sediment-core records, however, are in agreement with
    the last 10 years of this ice-core record, indicating declines in atmospheric
    Hg deposition.
