  abstract: Giant Mine, located in the city of Yellowknife (Northwest Territories,
    Canada), is a dramatic example of subarctic legacy contamination from mining activities,
    with remediation costs projected to exceed $1 billion. Operational between 1948
    and 2004, gold extraction at Giant Mine released large quantities of arsenic and
    metals from the roasting of arsenopyrite ore. We examined the long-term ecological
    effects of roaster emissions on Pocket Lake, a small lake at the edge of the Giant
    Mine lease boundary, using a spectrum of palaeoenvironmental approaches. A dated
    sedimentary profile tracked striking increases (approx. 1700%) in arsenic concentrations
    coeval with the initiation of Giant Mine operations. Large increases in mercury,
    antimony and lead also occurred. Synchronous changes in biological indicator assemblages
    from multiple aquatic trophic levels, in both benthic and pelagic habitats, indicate
    dramatic ecological responses to extreme metal(loid) contamination. At the peak
    of contamination, all Cladocera, a keystone group of primary consumers, as well
    as all planktonic diatoms, were functionally lost from the sediment record. No
    biological recovery has been inferred, despite the fact that the bulk of metal(loid)
    emissions occurred more than 50 years ago, and the cessation of all ore-roasting
    activities in Yellowknife in 1999.
