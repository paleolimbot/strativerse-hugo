  abstract: Recent sediment cores of the western Baltic Sea were analyzed for heavy
    metal and carbon isotope contents. The sedimentation rate was determined from
    radiocarbon dates to be 1.4 mm/yr. The ‘recent age’ of the sediment was about
    850 yr. Within the upper 20 cm of sediment, certain heavy metals became increasingly
    enriched towards the surface; Cd, Pb, Zn and Cu increased 7-, 4-, 3- and 2-fold,
    respectively, whereas Fe, Mn, Ni and Co remained unchanged. Simultaneously, the
    radiocarbon content decreased by about 14 per cent. The enrichment in heavy metals
    as well as the decrease in the 14C-concentration during the last 130 ± 30yr parallels
    industrial growth as reflected in European fossil fuel consumption within that
    same period of time. The near-surface sediments are affected by residues released
    from fossil fuels at the rate of about 30 g/m2 yr for the past two decades. The
    residues have a pronounced effect on the heavy metal and carbon isotope composition
    of the most Recent sediments allowing estimates to be made for sedimentation,
    erosion and heavy metal pollution.
