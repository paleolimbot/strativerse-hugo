  abstract: Heavy metal discharge from mining and smelting operations into aquatic
    ecosystems can cause long-term biological and ecological impacts. The upper Columbia
    River is highly contaminated with heavy metal wastes from nearby smelting operations
    in Trail, British Columbia, Canada, and to a lesser extent, Northport (Le Roi
    smelter), Washington, USA. Airborne emissions from the Trail operations were historically
    and are currently transported by prevailing winds down the Columbia River canyon,
    where particulate metals can be deposited into lakes and watersheds. In lakes,
    sediment cores contain records of past environmental conditions, providing a timeline
    of fundamental chemical and biological relationships within aquatic ecosystems,
    including records of airborne metal depositions. We analyzed trace metal concentrations
    (Ni, Cd, Zn, As, Cu, Sb, Pb, Hg) and Pb isotope compositions of sediment cores
    from six remote eastern Washington lakes to assess potential sources of atmospheric
    heavy metal deposition. Sediment cores displayed evidence to support trace metal
    loading as a direct consequence of smelting operations in Trail. Smelter contamination
    was detected 144 km downwind of the Trail Smelter. Cd, Sb, Pb (p < 0.001), and
    to a lesser extent As and Hg (p < 0.05) concentrations were correlated with Pb
    isotope compositions, suggesting that the Trail operations were likely the main
    source for these trace metals.
