  abstract: Thirty-two northern Florida lakes were analyzed to construct a transfer
    function relating surface sediment diatom assemblages to lakewater pH (R 2 =0.89,
    s.e.=0.34). A paleoecological analysis of sediment cores from six of these lakes
    indicated that two have become more acidic in the last 50 years. The diatom inferred
    (DI) pH of L. Barco has declined between 0.56–0.82 in the 1900's and DI ANC (acid
    neutralizing capacity) by 28–46 μeq l-1. The DI pH of nearby L. Suggs has declined
    0.91 pH units and its DI ANC by 19 μeq l-1. The timing of the inferred acidification
    is synchronous with known increases in emissions of sulfates and nitrates that
    are associated with acidic precipitation. Also, the increasing accumulation of
    substances related to emissions from the burning of fossil fuels (e.g., Pb, PAH)
    co-occurs with the lowering of DI pH in the sedimentary record. However, other
    processes may have accounted for or contributed to recent lake acidification.
    For instance, the drawdown of local water tables by human consumption may decrease
    the inseepage of ANC to seepage lakes. Such an effect would be synchronous with
    increasing depositions of sulfate. There is also clear evidence that Florida lakes
    are naturally acidic. Thus, paleoecological results indicate acidic deposition
    to be at certain contributor, but not necessarily the sole cause, of the recent
    further acidification of some naturally acidic Florida lakes.
