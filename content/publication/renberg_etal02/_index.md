  abstract: Analysis of stable lead isotopes and lead concentrations in lake-sediment
    deposits, not least in varved (annually-laminated) sediments, is a useful method
    to study lead pollution history. This paper presents details from a study of 31
    lakes in Sweden. Using a strong acid digestion of sediment samples and ICP-MS
    analyses, we have found that Swedish lake sediments have a high natural (pre-pollution)
    206[Pb]/207[Pb] ratio (mean 1.52±0.18, range 1.28–2.01, n=31 lakes). In contrast,
    atmospheric lead pollution derived from metal smelting processes, coal burning
    and from alkyl-lead added to petrol has a lower ratio (<1.2). Consequently, when
    pollution lead deposition began approximately 3500 years ago, the lead isotope
    ratio of the sediments started to decline, and in modern sediments it is typically
    <1.2. Using the isotope and concentration values and a mixing model, the relative
    contribution of pollution and natural lead in sediment samples can be calculated.
    The pollution lead records of the Swedish lake sediments show a consistent picture
    of the atmospheric lead pollution history. Some noticeable features are the Roman
    peak (approx. 0 ad), the large and permanent Medieval increase (approx. 1000 ad),
    peaks at approximately 1200 and 1530 ad, the rapid increase after World War II,
    the peak in the 1970s, and the large modern decline.
