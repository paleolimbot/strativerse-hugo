  abstract: Mercury contamination of remote lakes has been attributed to increasing
    deposition of atmospheric mercury, yet historic deposition rates and inputs from
    terrestrial sources are essentially unknown. Sediments of seven headwater lakes
    in Minnesota and Wisconsin were used to reconstruct regional modern and preindustrial
    deposition rates of mercury. Whole-basin mercury fluxes, determined from lake-wide
    arrays of dated cores, indicate that the annual deposition of atmospheric mercury
    has increased from 3.7 to 12.5 micrograms per square meter since 1850 and that
    25 percent of atmospheric mercury deposition to the terrestrial catchment is exported
    to the lake. The deposition increase is similar among sites, implying regional
    or global sources for the mercury entering these lakes.
