  abstract: We studied the effects of four decades of cultural eutrophication on Meretta
    Lake, in the Canadian High Arctic, through a multiproxy analysis of its sediments,
    including sedimentary pigments, metal concentrations, stable isotope ratios, chironomids,
    and diatoms. While Meretta Lake's biota clearly responded to nutrient inputs,
    the manner in which the changes differed from those expected in temperate lakes
    underlined the profound effects in Arctic lakes of extended ice and snow cover
    on light penetration, mixing, and interactions with the atmosphere. Hypolimnetic
    anoxia developed rapidly in Meretta Lake in response to sewage enrichment and
    was accompanied by the appearance of photosynthetic sulfur bacteria. Benthic communities
    responded rapidly to sewage inputs, but phytoplankton biomass did not increase
    until eutrophication was accompanied by climate warming, further reinforcing the
    importance of ice cover in controlling biotic processes in high Arctic lakes.
    With climate-mediated ice cover reductions in Meretta Lake, the response to eutrophication
    began to more closely resemble temperate processes. Recent trajectories indicate
    that slightly more than a decade after the cessation of sewage inputs, Meretta
    Lake is recovering toward pre-enrichment conditions.
