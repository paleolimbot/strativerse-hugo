  abstract: Analysis of the Greenland ice core covering the period from 3000 to 500
    years ago—the Greek, Roman, Medieval and Renaissance times—shows that lead is
    present at concentrations four times as great as natural values from about 2500
    to 1700 years ago (500 B.C. to 300 A.D.). These results show that Greek and Roman
    lead and silver mining and smelting activities polluted the middle troposphere
    of the Northern Hemisphere on a hemispheric scale two millennia ago, long before
    the Industrial Revolution. Cumulative lead fallout to the Greenland Ice Sheet
    during these eight centuries was as high as 15 percent of that caused by the massive
    use of lead alkyl additives in gasoline since the 1930s. Pronounced lead pollution
    is also observed during Medieval and Renaissance times.
