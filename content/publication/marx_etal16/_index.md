  abstract: During the past two centuries metal loads in the Earth's atmosphere and
    ecosystems have increased significantly over pre-industrial levels. This has been
    associated with deleterious effects to ecosystem processes and human health. The
    magnitude of this toxic metal burden, as well as the spatial and temporal patterns
    of metal enrichment, is recorded in sedimentary archives across the globe. This
    paper presents a compilation of selected Pb contamination records from lakes (n = 10),
    peat mires (n = 10) and ice fields (n = 7) from Europe, North and South America,
    Asia, Australia and the Northern and Southern Hemisphere polar regions. These
    records quantify changes in Pb enrichment in remote from source environments.
    The presence of anthropogenic Pb in the environment has a long history, extending
    as far back as the early to mid-Holocene in North America, Europe and East Asia.
    However, results show that Pb contamination in the Earth's environment became
    globally ubiquitous at the beginning of the Second Industrial Revolution (c.1850–1890
    CE), after which the magnitude of Pb contamination increased significantly. This
    date therefore serves as an effective global marker for the onset of the Anthropocene.
    Current global average Pb enrichment rates are between 6 and 35 times background,
    however Pb contamination loads are spatially variable. For example, they are >100
    times background in Europe and North America and 5–15 times background in Antarctica.
    Despite a recent decline in Pb loads in some regions, most notably Europe and
    North America, anthropogenic Pb remains highly enriched and universally present
    in global ecosystems, while concentrations are increasing in some regions (Australia,
    Asia and parts of South America and Antarctica). There is, however, a paucity
    of Pb enrichment records outside of Europe, which limits assessments of global
    contamination.
