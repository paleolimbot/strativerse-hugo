  abstract: To evaluate the contribution of the long-range transport of heavy metals
    from the Asian continent to the enrichment of surface sediments in western Japan,
    heavy-metal (Cd, Cu, Pb, Sb, and Zn) concentrations were measured in sediment
    cores collected at three sites each in Lakes Shinji and Nakaumi. Sedimentation
    fluxes of these metals were calculated on the basis of their concentrations in
    excess of their background concentrations. Pb showed similar sedimentation fluxes
    in the sites, suggesting a predominant contribution of atmospheric deposition
    of Pb transported from the Asian continent to the input to the lakes. In contrast,
    the sedimentation fluxes of heavy metals other than Pb in the surface sediments
    were markedly high near the estuary of a principal river flowing into Lake Nakaumi.
    A highly positive correlation was observed between the Cd and Zn concentrations
    in the cores at each site (r 2 = 0.84–0.97). The Cd/Zn ratios in the surface sediments
    (1990–2007) indicated that Lake Shinji sediments have ratios of 0.0067–0.0074,
    higher than those of Tokyo Bay sediments (0.0054 on average in 1990–2003), which
    have been polluted primarily by effluent discharges. In contrast, the ratios in
    Lake Nakaumi sediments (0.0053–0.0060) were close to those in Tokyo Bay sediments.
    Rainwater and aerosols, which were strongly affected by air pollutants from the
    Asian continent, have much higher Cd/Zn ratios of 0.014–0.016. This suggests that
    the Lake Shinji sediments with higher Cd/Zn ratios are less affected by effluent
    discharges. Hence, Lake Shinji sediments may be suitable for assessing the environmental
    impact of the long-range transport of heavy metals from the Asian continent.
