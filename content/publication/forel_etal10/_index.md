  abstract: 'Two peat sequences were sampled in the vicinity of the main mining districts
    of the Vosges Mountains: Sainte-Marie-aux-Mines and Plancher-les-Mines. Lead isotopic
    compositions and excess lead fluxes were calculated for each of these radiocarbon-dated
    sequences. Geochemical records are in very good agreement with the mining history
    of the area, well known over the last millennium. Except for an anomaly corresponding
    to the Middle Bronze Age which has not yet been resolved, there is no clear geochemical
    evidence of local metal production in the Vosges before the 10th century as excess
    lead deposition archived between 500BC and 500AD is attributed to long-range transport
    of polluted particulate matter. The approach described here can be applied to
    other mining districts where archaeological evidence is scarce or even lacking,
    but where past exploitation is suspected.'
