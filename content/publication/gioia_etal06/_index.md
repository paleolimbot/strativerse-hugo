  abstract: 'Pb concentration and Pb isotopic composition are known to represent powerful
    tools to investigate the history of Pb pollution in water and sediments. In this
    paper, we present and discuss the results of a detailed study of sediments deposited
    in the Paranoá Lake, a 44-year-old artificial reservoir in Brasília, central Brazil.
    Pb concentration and isotopic composition of the sediments were obtained by ID-TIMS,
    on three different sample fractions: leachate, residue, and bulk sample. The leachate
    phase has proven to be most efficient to distinguish between anthropogenic and
    natural Pb inputs. In the Paranoá lake, important sources of contamination were
    recognized, producing higher Pb concentrations (max. 37.68 ppm) and significant
    variations in Pb isotopic composition, relative to the regional geogenic background.
    Contamination of the sediments due to anthropogenic activity produced less radiogenic
    Pb isotopic compositions (206Pb/207Pb=1.15–1.17), compared with the regional natural
    composition (206Pb/207Pb=1.19–1.25). 210Pb analyses along one bore hole which
    sampled the entire sediment section indicated a sedimentation rate of 8.2±1.8
    mm/year. The combined use of the 210Pb ages and Pb isotopic compositions of these
    samples revealed three distinct periods in the lake history: (1) the period of
    the time formation of the lake in 1959 until ca. 1970 was characterized by the
    deposition of sediments displaying more radiogenic Pb isotopic signature, (2)
    the time interval from the start of the process of eutrophication at 1970, until
    1995, was characterized by the deposition of sediments having less radiogenic
    average compositions, and (3) from 1995 until the present represents a period
    of recovery of water quality, after two sewage treatment stations started to operate.'
