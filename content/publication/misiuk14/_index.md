  abstract: Lakes occurring in watersheds that have undergone urban development are
    known to be subjected to an array of anthropogenically-induced impacts. Since
    1920, First Lake in Lower Sackville, Nova Scotia has been the focus of significant
    watershed development, and lake water quality degradation is an ongoing concern.
    Second lake is located nearby, is of similar size, and is located in an undeveloped
    watershed. Carbon and nitrogen stable isotope analyses and x-ray fluorescence
    spectroscopy data from lake sediment gravity cores were used to construct a c.600-year
    record of environmental change for each lake in order to de-couple natural water
    quality variability from anthropogenically-induced variation. Increases in specific
    elements (Nb, Y, Sr, Cu) associated with local gold mining were used to cross
    correlate and date the lake sediment records. Increases in Pb concentrations above
    background levels were also used for temporal control. Modern water quality data
    indicated that though both lakes stratify strongly over the summer, First Lake
    alone experiences hypolimnetic anoxia. Though both lake proxy records indicated
    significant natural water quality variability, stable isotope (δ13C, δ15N) and
    XRF (Fe, Mn, Ti) data indicated that First Lake alone was subject to substantial
    and persistent increases in natural autochthonous productivity during the past
    70 years that can be attributed directly to local watershed development. Data
    indicated that though logging and/or mining as well as commercial development
    has likely impacted both lakes, residential development has had the strongest
    negative impact on water quality. This study has shown that the paleolimnological
    method can be used to quantify the relative impact of different types of development
    on lake water quality, a fundamental step in developing effective watershed management
    strategies.
