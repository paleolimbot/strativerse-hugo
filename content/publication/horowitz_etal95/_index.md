  abstract: During the summer of 1990, 12 gravity cores were collected in Lake Coeur
    d'Alene, Idaho at various depths and in a variety of depositional environments.
    All core subsamples were analysed to determine the bulk sediment chemistry; selected
    subsamples were analysed for trace element partitioning and 137Cs activity. The
    purpose of these analyses was to determine the trace element concentrations and
    distributions in the sediment column and to try to establish a trace element geochemical
    history of the lake in relation to mining and mining-related discharge operations
    in the area. Substantial portions of the near-surface sediments in Lake Coeur
    d'Alene are markedly enriched in Ag, As, Cd, Hg, Pb, Sb and Zn, and slightly enriched
    in Cu, Fe and Mn. Variations in the thickness of the trace element-rich sediments,
    which range from more than 119 cm to as little as 17 cm, indicate that the source
    of much of this material is the Coeur d'Alene River. An estimated 75 million tonnes
    of trace element-rich sediments have been deposited on or in the lake bed. Estimated
    trace element masses in excess of those considered representative of background
    conditions range from a high of 468 000 tonnes of Pb to a low of 260 tonnes of
    Hg. The similarity between the trace element-rich surface and subsurface sediments
    with respect to their location, their bulk chemistry, their interelement relations
    and their trace element partitioning indicate that the sources and/or concentrating
    mechanisms causing the trace element enrichment in the lake sediments have probably
    been the same through-out their depositional history. Based on a Mt St Helens'ash
    layer from the 1980 eruption, ages estimated from 137Cs activity and the presence
    of 80 discernible and presumably annual layers in a core collected near the Coeur
    d'Alene River delta indicate that deposition rates for the trace element-rich
    sediments have ranges from 2.1 to 1.3 cm/year. These data also indicate that the
    deposition of trace element-rich sediments began, at least in the Coeur d'Alene
    River delta, some time between 1895 and 1910, dates consistent with the onset
    of mining and ore processing activities that began in the area in the 1880s.
