  abstract: Twentieth century environmental lead chronologies for the western North
    Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian Oceans have been reconstructed from annually-banded
    scleractinian corals. Measurements of lattice-bound Pb in sequential coral bands
    reveal temporal changes in surface water Pb concentrations and Pb isotopic distributions.
    Perturbations are observable in all specimens studied, attesting to global augmentation
    of environmental Pb by industrialization. In the western North Atlantic, Pb perturbations
    have occurred in direct response to the American industrial revolution and the
    subsequent introduction and phasing-out of alkyl Pb additives in gasoline. Surface
    ocean conditions near Bermuda may be reliably reconstructed from the coral data
    via a lead distribution coefficient of 2.3 for the species,Diploria strigosa.
    Based on210Pb measurements, a similar distribution coefficient may be characteristic
    of corals in general. Surface Pb concentrations in the pre-industrial Sargasso
    Sea were about 15–20 pM. Concentrations rose to near 90 pM by 1923 as a result
    of metals manufacture and fossil fuel combustion. Beginning in the late 1940's,
    increased utilization of leaded gasoline eventually led to a peak concentration
    of 240 pM in 1971, representing an approximate 15-fold increase over background.
    Surface ocean concentrations are presently declining rapidly (128 pM in 1984)
    as a result of curtailed alkyl Pb usage. Lead isotopic shifts parallel the concentration
    record indicating that characteristic industrial and alkyl Pb source signatures
    have not changed appreciably in time. Industrial releases recorded in the Florida
    Keys reflect a weaker source and evidence of recirculated Pb (5–6 years old) from
    the North Atlantic subtropical gyre. An inferred background concentration of 38
    pM suggests influence of shelf and/or resuspended inputs of Pb to these coastal
    waters. In remote areas of the South Pacific and Indian Oceans, industrial signals
    are fainter and the corals studied much younger than their Atlantic counterparts.
    Contemporary Pb concentrations implied by coral measurements (assumingKD = 2.3)
    are 40–50 pM for surface waters near Tutuila and Galapagos in the South Pacific,
    and 25–29 pM near Mauritius in the Indian Ocean. A single coral band from Fiji
    (1920 ± 5yr) implies a pre-industrial surface water concentration of 16–19 pM
    Pb for the South Pacific. In view of reported surface water measurements and the
    North Atlantic coral data, the Pacific coral extrapolations may be slightly high.
    This could be a result of small variations inKD among different coral genera,
    or incorporation of diagenetic Pb by corals sampled in coastal environments.
