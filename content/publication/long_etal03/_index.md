  abstract: Sediment cores were extracted from three lakes in northeastern New Jersey
    and one lake on western Long Island, New York, as part of the U.S. Geological
    Survey National Water-Quality Assessment Program. Sediment layers were dated by
    use of cesium-137 (137Cs), copper, lead, or dichlorodiphenyl-trichloroethane (DDT)
    profiles. Sediment layers were analyzed for seven selected trace elements, including
    arsenic, cadmium, chromium, lead, mercury, nickel, and zinc, and five hydrophobic
    organochlorine compounds, including chlordane, dieldrin, total DDT, total polychlorinated
    biphenyls (PCBs), and total polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). All seven
    trace elements were detected throughout the cores from all four lakes. Concentrations
    of all elements, except arsenic, were elevated in the three cores from lakes within
    urbanized watersheds (Packanack Lake, Orange Reservoir, and Newbridge Pond) relative
    to the concentrations in the lake core collected below the largely forested, reference
    watershed (Clyde Potts Reservoir). Results of trend analyses indicate that concentrations
    of all trace elements, with the exception of arsenic and lead, were relatively
    constant throughout the core from the minimally urbanized Clyde Potts Reservoir.
    In urban lakes, significant upward trends in concentrations from deeper to shallower
    sediments were observed either to peak concentrations or throughout the core for
    all elements, with the exception of chromium at all lakes and arsenic and nickel
    at Orange Reservoir. This finding indicates that changes in population and land
    use in the urbanized watersheds over the period of sedimentary record have contributed
    to upward trends in trace-element concentrations. Although downward trends in
    concentrations were observed for some trace elements in the years after their
    concentrations peaked, concentrations of all trace elements in urban lake cores
    were higher in the most recently deposited sediments than at the base of each
    respective core. Lead concentrations over time were highly correlated with the
    population in the vicinity of the lake until the concentration peak in sediment
    deposited in the mid-1970’s. Concentrations of lead in lake sediment appear to
    be closely related to the use of leaded gasoline because lead concentrations generally
    decreased after the use of leaded gasoline was phased-out in the mid-1970’s. Zinc
    concentrations were highly correlated with population over the entire length of
    the core. In general, zinc concentrations increased in the three urbanized watersheds,
    probably in response to increasing population and vehicular use. This trend was
    not evident at Clyde Potts Reservoir, however, where vehicular traffic in the
    watershed is minimal. Detectable concentrations of chlordane, total DDT, and total
    PCBs were present in cores from all lakes; however, dieldrin was detected only
    in the Newbridge Pond and Packanack Lake cores. Concentrations generally were
    higher in cores from the urbanized Newbridge Pond and Orange Reservoir watersheds
    than in those from the minimally urbanized Clyde Potts Reservoir watershed. With
    the exception of chlordane in
