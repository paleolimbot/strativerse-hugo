  abstract: Past human activities can be reflected in the elemental composition of
    contemporary soils. We asked how much historical land-use identified according
    to historical maps is reflected by the multi-elemental signatures of soils in
    an originally medieval village abandoned after WWII. Using X-ray fluorescence
    spectrometry, we determined the content of 24 elements in soil samples from former
    arable fields, field boundaries, forests, built-up area, and permanent grasslands.
    Previous human activities were connected with the accumulation of 13 elements
    such as the usually thus interpreted P, Ca, Zn, and Cu, but also with elements
    rarely used in archaeological studies such as Mg, K, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Ni, Rb, Zr,
    and Sr. The content of P, Ca, Cu, Zn, Ni, Fe, V, Cr, and Zr decreased on former
    fields with the distance from the most enriched built-up area. This can be explained
    by the most intensive deposition of biomass ashes and manuring of gardens and
    fields close to the village. With the exception of Pb accumulated sub-recently
    because of aerial deposition, the lowest content of anthropogenic elements was
    recorded in continuous forest. The chemical signatures recorded were much stronger
    than those in previously studied medieval villages in the Czech Republic abandoned
    in the 15th or 16th centuries. This is because of the long period of the settlement’s
    existence since medieval times and in addition because of the short time since
    its abandonment. Although frequently neglected, the multi-elemental composition
    of soils in deserted settlements can be considered as cultural heritage similarly
    to the relicts of buildings or still visible field patterns.
