  abstract: Sediment cores and soil samples were taken from nine lakes and their catchments
    across England with varying degrees of direct human disturbance. Mercury (Hg)
    analysis demonstrated a range of impacts, many from local sources, resulting from
    differing historical and contemporary site usage and management. Lakes located
    in industrially important areas showed clear evidence for early Hg pollution with
    concentrations in sediments reaching 400–1600 ng g−1 prior to the mid-19th century.
    Control of inputs resulting from local management practices and a greater than
    90% reduction in UK Hg emissions since 1970 were reflected by reduced Hg pollution
    in some lakes. However, having been a sink for Hg deposition for centuries, polluted
    catchment soils are now the major Hg source for most lakes and consequently recovery
    from reduced Hg deposition is being delayed.
