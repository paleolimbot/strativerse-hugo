  abstract: Total mercury (Hg) profiles of sediment cores from lakes serve as historical
    records of Hg pollution. They do not, however, provide information about temporal
    variations in the abundance of the toxic, preferentially bioaccumulated species
    methylmercury (CH3Hg+), whose production rate is largely a function of environmental
    variables that control the growth and activities of Hg-methylating and Hg-demethylating
    bacteria and the bioavailability of the inorganic Hg(II) from which CH3Hg+ is
    formed. Earlier studies showed that CH3Hg+ in freshwater food webs had anomalously
    high δ201Hg/δ199Hg ratios and, similarly, that the δ201Hg/δ199Hg ratio of Hg in
    a core from a severely Hg-polluted lake paralleled temporal changes in CH3Hg+
    production. The present study was undertaken to test the hypothesis that variations
    in the δ201Hg/δ199Hg ratios of sediment cores from lakes reflect historical variations
    in CH3Hg+ production in the lakes. Core profiles of δ201Hg/δ199Hg ratios and total
    Hg concentrations from three widely separated, environmentally distinct temperate
    lakes polluted with Hg from different industrial sources, and one practically
    pristine Arctic lake, were examined, and changes attributable to known historical
    events were noted. Hg pollution led to increases in the δ201Hg/δ199Hg ratio, suggesting
    enhanced production of CH3Hg+, but the lakes showed different patterns of variation
    over time, implying the influence of site-specific environmental and biotic factors.
    In one lake the δ201Hg/δ199Hg ratio increased at the onset of each of three pollution
    episodes but peaked and then declined, suggesting a surge in methylation that
    was reversed by demethylation. In another lake, mercury pollution initiated a
    long-term upward trend in the isotope ratio, with secondary maxima and minima
    superimposed on it, implying a progressive increase in CH3Hg+, with successive
    shorter-term changes caused by fluctuations in methylation and demethylation rates.
    In the third lake, moderately elevated isotope ratios and one large maximum were
    associated with Hg contamination, but the maximum is attributable to accelerated
    eutrophication that intensified CH3Hg+ production. In the Arctic lake, the isotope
    ratio varied with climate change, decreasing during warming trends and increasing
    during cooling phases. These results constitute evidence that δ201Hg/δ199Hg ratios
    of sediment cores from lakes record historical variations in the net rate of CH3Hg+
    production.
