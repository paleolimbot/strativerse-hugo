Parameters are things that were measured that, generally, can be compared. They are intended to distill out the nearly infinite variability in measurement techniques while providing the ability to search for records on which similar things have been measured. [Records](/record) define one or more parameters that have been measured on them, usually because they appear in the methods or results section of related [publications](/publication).
