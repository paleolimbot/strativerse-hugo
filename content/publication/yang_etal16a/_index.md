  abstract: 'Rapid industrialization and urbanization has caused large emission and
    potential contamination of mercury (Hg) in urban environment. However, little
    is known about the impact of socioeconomic factor on Hg accumulation in sediment.
    In the present study, historical record of anthropogenic Hg deposition of Shanghai
    was reconstructed by using three sediment cores from three park lakes (C1: Luxun
    Park; C2: Fuxing island Park; C3: Xinjiangwan Park). Meanwhile, the influence
    of socioeconomic factor to Hg emissions and sedimentary record was calculated
    based on an extended STIRPAT (stochastic impacts by regression on population,
    affluence and technology) model. The profiles of Hg levels and fluxes in the three
    sediment cores showed that Shanghai has recently undergone urbanization. The anthropogenic
    Hg fluxes exhibited fluctuant increases from ∼1900 to present and accelerated
    after the establishment of the People’s Republic of China in 1949 and the implementation
    of reform and opening up policy in 1978. The mean flux ratios of Hg in post-2000
    were 2.2, 12, and 2.7 in the C1, C2 and C3 cores, respectively. The extended STIRPAT
    model was constructed based on strong positive relationships between socioeconomic
    factors and Hg fluxes, revealing that the proportion of coal consumption, the
    urbanization rate, and the proportion of heavy industry were the three most important
    driving factors for Hg accumulations in urban sediment of Shanghai.'
