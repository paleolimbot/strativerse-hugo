  abstract: Sediment cores from nine lakes in southern Norway (N) and six in northern
    New England (NE) were dated by 137Cs, 210Pb and in NE also by pollen, and were
    analyzed geochemically and for diatoms. Cores from two N and three NE lakes were
    analyzed for cladocerans. 137Cs dating is unreliable in these lakes, probably
    due to mobility of Cs in the sediment. In Holmvatn sediment, an up-core increase
    in Fe, starting ca. 1900, correlates with geochemical indications of decreasing
    mechanical erosion of soils. Diatoms indicate a lake acidification starting in
    the 1920's. We propose that soil Fe was mobilized and runoff acidified by acidic
    precipitation and/or by soil acidification resulting from vegetational succession
    following reduced grazing. Even minor land use changes or disturbances in lake
    watersheds introduce ambiguity to the sedimentary evidence relating to atmospheric
    influences. Diatom counts from surface sediments in 36 N and 31 NE lakes were
    regressed against contemporary water pH to obtain coefficients for computing past
    pH from subsurface counts. Computed decreases of 0.3–0.8 pH units start between
    I890 and I930 in N lakes already acidic (pH 5.0–5.5) before the decrease. These
    and lesser decreases in other lakes start decades to over a century after the
    first sedimentary indications of atmospheric heavy metal pollution. It is proposed
    that the acidification of precipitation accompanied the metal pollution. The delays
    in lake acidification may be due to buffering by the lakes and watersheds. The
    magnitude of acidification and heavy metal loading of the lakes parallels air
    pollution gradients. Shift in cladoceran remains are contemporary with acidification,
    preceding elimination of fishes.
