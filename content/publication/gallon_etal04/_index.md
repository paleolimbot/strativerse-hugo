  abstract: Triplicate porewater lead concentration profiles were determined on six
    occasions in a Canadian Shield lake. Total Pb concentrations were also measured
    in a dated core obtained at the same site. This information, as well as an extensive
    dataset comprising ancillary geochemical measurements on porewaters and sediment
    and the population densities of benthic animals, is used in a one-dimensional
    transport-reaction diagenetic model to investigate the transport and mobilization
    of Pb in these sediments. Application of the model consistently indicates the
    presence of a zone of Pb production to the porewaters that lies above a zone of
    Pb consumption. The profiles of various porewater constituents and thermodynamic
    calculations indicate that Pb is mobilized in the zone of production by the reductive
    dissolution of iron oxyhydroxides, whereas it is removed in the zone of consumption
    by precipitation as a solid sulfide. Rate constants are estimated for reductive
    iron dissolution (kdFe(III) = 2.0 ± 0.5 × 10−1 cm3 mol−1 s−1), Pb adsorption on
    iron oxyhydroxides (kadsPb = 98 ± 55 cm3 mol−1 s−1), and Pb precipitation (kpptPb
    = 8 × 10−20 mol cm−3 s−1 to 16 ± 13 × 10−22 mol cm−3 s−1, depending on the solubility
    product assumed for the precipitation of PbS). According to model calculations,
    diagenetic processes, such as remobilization, molecular diffusion, bioturbation,
    and bioirrigation have a negligible influence on the solid phase Pb profile. In
    agreement with this finding, the present-day fluxes of dissolved Pb by diffusion
    (JDPb = −6.5 × 10−11 mol cm−2 yr−1), bioturbation (JBPb = −1.1 × 10−13 mol cm−2
    yr−1), and bioirrigation (JIPb = −1.5 × 10−11 mol cm−2 yr−1) are small compared
    to the flux of Pb deposited with settling particles (JSPb = 5.3 × 10−9 mol cm−2
    yr−1).
